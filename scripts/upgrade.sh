# scripts/upgrade.sh — move a from-source CloudeCode install to a release tag.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/upgrade.sh [TAG] [--yes] [--remote URL] [--install-dir DIR]
#
#   TAG            release tag to upgrade to, e.g. 0.9.0 or v0.9.0. Defaults
#                  to the newest published release tag on the remote.
#   --yes / -y     skip the confirmation prompt (for the menu bar app or CI).
#                  Without it, a non-interactive shell refuses outright
#                  rather than silently assuming yes.
#   --remote URL   override which git remote to read release tags from.
#                  Defaults to config.json's `updates.remote`, else the
#                  checkout's own `origin`, else the public upstream — the
#                  exact precedence src/core/update_check.py already uses.
#   --install-dir DIR   the CloudeCode checkout to upgrade. Defaults to the
#                  repository this script lives in. Exists so this script
#                  can be rehearsed against a throwaway copy without editing
#                  it — see README "Verifying this script" section.
#
# THIS SCRIPT ONLY MANAGES A FROM-SOURCE INSTALL (README "Path B"): a git
# checkout with its own venv/, .env, config.json, running via ./start.sh /
# ./stop.sh / ./reset.sh on port 8000. The packaged .app has no in-place
# upgrader — see the README's "Upgrading the packaged .app" section — but a
# packaged install's server payload IS this same source tree underneath
# (macOS/bootstrap.js rsyncs it from the bundle on every launch), so the code
# and config-migration story below is identical either way.
#
# What this script does, in order:
#   1. Resolve the CURRENT version. Refuses to continue if it cannot be
#      determined — see "could not evaluate" in the README.
#   2. Resolve the TARGET tag (given or latest) and confirm it is a real
#      published release tag.
#   3. If current == target: report and exit 0. Idempotent — no stop, no
#      restart, no backup on a no-op run.
#   4. Compute where the backup will land (deterministic; no copying yet).
#   5. State the plan and require confirmation (unless --yes).
#   6. Stop the server.
#   6a. Take the backup of user state (.env, config.json, session/auth
#      state, including refresh_tokens.db) into the directory from step 4,
#      now that the server is stopped, and print that path prominently.
#      SQLite files are copied via VACUUM INTO + integrity_check, not a
#      raw file copy - see upgrade_rollback_common.sh's SQLite-safe-copying
#      note. Still runs before anything destructive to the CODE.
#   7. `git fetch --tags` then `git checkout tags/<target>` (detached HEAD).
#   8. `pip install -r requirements.txt` for the new tag's dependencies.
#   9. Run the config migration (src/core/config_migration.py) — additive,
#      idempotent, takes its OWN config.json.bak on top of the backup from
#      step 6a.
#  10. Restart the server.
#  11. Verify: the server answers on /health AND reports the target version.
#      A failure here is a FAILURE, not a warning — see verify_upgrade in
#      scripts/upgrade_lib/upgrade_rollback_common.sh.
#
# Exit codes: 0 success (including the idempotent no-op case). 1 on any
# failure or refusal, with a [FAIL] or [UNKNOWN] line explaining which.
