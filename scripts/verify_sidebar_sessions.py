"""Measure the session sidebar's pinning, ordering and density in a REAL browser.

Every number this prints comes from getBoundingClientRect() inside a real
Chromium loading the real client/js/session-sidebar-*.js and the real
stylesheets through tests/manual/sidebar-sessions-geometry-harness.html.
Nothing here infers a box from a state object: this project shipped a
feature with 282 green state assertions that rendered zero pixels, and a
density control is exactly the kind of feature that can be entirely green
in a state model while every row on screen is the same height.

The keyboard reorder is driven with REAL key events through
page.keyboard.press(), aimed at a row that has REAL focus, because
"operable without a mouse" is a claim about what the browser does with a
keystroke, not about whether a method can be called.

THREE OUTCOMES, and they exit differently:
  0  PASS  - every assertion measured and held
  1  FAIL  - something was measured and was wrong
  2  CANNOT DETERMINE - the measurement could not be taken at all
             (playwright missing, browser would not launch, harness never
             became ready). Never reported as a pass.
