# Mutation check for feat/db-is-authoritative.
#
# A test that passes is only evidence if it can also FAIL. Each mutation
# below reintroduces one specific way this change can silently hand the
# user a wrong answer, and every one must turn the suite red.
#
# BLOCK 0 - BASELINE GATE. The suite is run UNMUTATED first. A mutation
# score computed over an already-red baseline is meaningless: every
# mutant "dies" because the suite was dead before it arrived. The script
# refuses to proceed rather than reporting a number nobody can use.
#
# BLOCK 1 - THE VISIBLE BUG. His config.json holds three names for
# /Users/jsugamele/Development/ses_ec5bf2a3, and the launcher drew all
# three, each expanding the same two child sessions. These mutants put
# the read back on config.json, drop the deduplication in the degraded
# fallback, and take the row id back off the response so the client has
# to look it up by raw path again - which is the exact mechanism that
# made three nodes share children.
#
# BLOCK 2 - THE ROLLBACK ARTIFACT. The entire justification for the
# change is that config.json stays a file the user can revert to. These
# mutants stop writing it, write it before the commit instead of after,
# write it from the caller's belief rather than from the table, drop the
# atomic write, and - the worst one - overwrite it with an empty list
# when the database cannot be read, which turns the rollback file into a
# data shredder.
#
# BLOCK 3 - THE THREE OUTCOMES. Every collapse of "could not evaluate"
# into "fine" or "broken": an unreachable database rendering as an empty
# project list, a degraded read that still allows writes, a failed
# comparison reported as agreement, and an empty table with a populated
# config reported as "you have no projects".
#
# BLOCK 4 - DISAGREEMENT. A difference that is detected but not reported
# is the same defect as one that was never detected. These mutants drop
# each bucket of the diff, fold an expected duplicate into the
# missing-project bucket so the report cries wolf, and make a
# null-versus-empty description a permanent mismatch nobody can clear.
#
# BLOCK 5 - IDENTITY AND ORDERING. root is the identity; display names
# are not unique and never were. These mutants join on the name, resolve
# an ambiguous name by taking the first row, let a rename rewrite the
# root, and invert the launcher's most-recently-used ordering.
#
# All mutated files are restored on exit, including on failure. Modelled
# on scripts/ci/mutate-projects-presence.sh - same harness shape, same
# restore-on-exit discipline.
