# A test that passes is only evidence if it can also FAIL. Each mutation
# below reintroduces one specific way this control could go wrong again:
# the one stored boolean losing its key or its default, the three-outcome
# classify() collapsing two distinct states into one (the exact defect
# themeAudioStatus.js's whole file exists to retire, one layer up), the
# could-not-evaluate outcome being guessed instead of named, or the
# single-shared-button placement rule leaking a second instance or
# forgetting to detach on a barless screen. Every one must turn the
# suite red. The source file is restored on exit, including on failure.
