# Mutation check for the EIGHT findings of the SECOND adversarial round.
#
# Sibling of mutate-sessions-identity.sh, which covers the first round.
# Same reasoning for keeping it separate: every mutation here
# reintroduces a defect that survived a full round of hardening AND its
# mutation suite, and was only caught by a second adversarial pass. A
# passing test is evidence only if it can also fail.
#
# V1 the ROW delimiter: str.splitlines() recognises ten line boundaries,
#    tmux rejects only seven, so a session name containing NEL, LS or PS
#    turned one tmux row into several parser rows and forged the identity
#    triple. The field parser was already hardened; the hole was one
#    layer up in the caller.
# V2 the import's step-5 path wrote a NULL discriminator whether or not
#    the persisted entry knew one, silently unarming the
#    instance-mismatch guard.
# V3 a synthesized epoch of 0 entered the identity key, so the ownership
#    resolver issued a permanent CONFIDENT NEGATIVE against a name.
# V4 the no-server markers were an unanchored substring test over
#    user-controlled text (the socket path is echoed into stderr).
# V5 an unparseable meta.schema_version collapsed to 0, which silently
#    disabled the pre-migration backup on a populated database.
# V6 the errno allowlist is one English string and glibc localises
#    strerror, so a non-English locale made the check never clear.
# V7 the trail called a retry after a CLEAN failure an interrupt.
# V8 nothing deletes a sessions row, so a wrong owned row is permanent.
#
# All mutated files are restored on exit, including on failure.
