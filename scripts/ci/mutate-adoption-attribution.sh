# Mutation check for S7: durable adoption, and project attribution.
#
# A test that passes is only evidence if it can also FAIL. Each mutation
# below reintroduces one specific way this build step can silently hand
# the user a wrong answer, and every one must turn the suite red.
#
# BLOCK 1 - ADOPTION MUST STICK. The pre-S7 state was that adoption was
# recorded nowhere: the tmux name was deliberately kept out of an
# in-memory set that is rebuilt from a live listing anyway, so a claim
# did not survive a page reload. These mutants unwire the persistence,
# demote an adopted row back to observed on the next sighting, and make
# adopted_at last-write-wins. The last one is subtle and constant: the UI
# re-enters the adopt path on every session re-open, so a moving
# timestamp rewrites history several times a day.
#
# BLOCK 2 - ZERO ROWS IS NOT SUCCESS. Adoption is an UPDATE. When it
# matches nothing the honest answers are "no row carries that instance"
# and "that row is a corpse", and they are different facts. These mutants
# collapse them into each other, into success, and into an exception.
#
# BLOCK 3 - THE LISTING GATE. An unavailable probe carries no rows BY
# CONTRACT, so a missing name proves nothing. Reading it as "the session
# died" tells the user his live session is gone because tmux timed out.
#
# BLOCK 4 - ATTRIBUTION, THE PART THAT WAS ACTUALLY BROKEN ON HIS BOX.
# Nine sessions came out unknown because the input was never collected,
# not because the rule was wrong. So the mutants here attack BOTH: the
# rule (string prefixes instead of components, string length instead of
# depth, no expanduser, a forbidden resolve) and the WIRING (the probe
# removed from the import call site, the backfill neutered). A rule that
# works on paper while nothing feeds it is exactly the state the live
# database was already in.
#
# BLOCK 5 - THE THREE-OUTCOME COLLAPSES, on the wire and on screen.
# 'none' and 'unknown' rendered as one string, an unprobeable row written
# as though it were measured, an unrecognised origin defaulted to the
# most believable value.
#
# All mutated files are restored on exit, including on failure.
