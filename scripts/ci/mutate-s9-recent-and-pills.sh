# Mutation check for S9: listing-time fingerprint pills, and the
# datastore-backed RECENT group.
#
# A test that passes is only evidence if it can also FAIL. Each mutation
# below reintroduces one specific way this build step can silently hand
# the user a wrong answer, and every one must turn the suite red.
#
# BLOCK 1 - THE PILL MUST SAY A GUESS, NOT A FACT. list_attachable_sessions
# now fingerprints instead of always answering (None, "unknown"). These
# mutants make a fingerprinted value render as a stored fact, make a miss
# silently keep the previous agent_type, and defeat the cache so the
# listing re-probes tmux on every call (the exact slow-launcher defect
# the caching requirement exists to prevent).
#
# BLOCK 2 - GET /sessions/recent'S THREE OUTCOMES. 'never_probed' and
# 'probe_unavailable' must never collapse into 'ok', and the reverse must
# not happen either (a healthy probe must not be reported as unavailable).
#
# BLOCK 3 - THE DEFENSIVE FILTER. Even though the SQL query already
# restricts to lifecycle='stopped', the route re-checks. Removing that
# re-check must be observable through a mocked repository layer, proving
# the guarantee is not resting solely on the query one layer below it.
#
# All mutated files are restored on exit, including on failure.
