#
#   ./scripts/ci/roundtrip-upgrade-downgrade.sh [options]
#
#   --old REF         the version being downgraded TO. Default v0.8.1, the
#                     newest published release tag that predates BOTH the
#                     config_version machinery and the datastore.
#   --new REF         the version being upgraded TO. Default
#                     integration/ui-only.
#   --source-repo DIR the repo to clone the two versions out of. Default:
#                     the repo this script lives in.
#   --seed-config F   config.json to start the OLD install from. Default:
#                     tests/fixtures/roundtrip/old_config.json. Point it at
#                     a COPY of a real config to test a real shape; never
#                     at the real file, this harness writes to it.
#   --work-dir DIR    throwaway run directory. Default a timestamped dir
#                     under $HOME/Scratch/llmScratch.
#   --venv DIR        an existing venv to reuse. Default: build one in the
#                     work dir. Both versions pin identical requirements,
#                     so one venv serves both.
#   --port N          base port to probe upward from. Default 8137.
#                     NEVER 8000 (a real install) and NEVER 5000 (AirPlay).
#   --keep            do not delete the work dir on success.
#
# SAFETY. This script only ever writes inside its own work directory. It
# clones the source repo rather than checking anything out in place, it
# never touches ~/Library/Application Support/CloudeCode (it points
# CLOUDE_STATE_DIR at the work dir), it never runs nuke.sh or reset.sh,
# and it starts servers only on a port it has just proven to be free.
#
# Exit codes: 0 every step passed. 1 a step failed. 2 a step could not be
# evaluated and none failed. 3 the harness itself could not set up - which
# is NOT a verdict about the round trip, and is reported as such.
#
# Portability: bash 3.2 (macOS /bin/bash). No ${v,,}, no declare -A, no
# mapfile, no `wait -n`.

# ensure_config_migrated -> ensure_db_migrated -> run_first_run_import.
# That startup sequence IS the migration, and starting the server is how
# this harness runs it.

# --- 2b. SESSION METADATA: seed it the way the OLD version writes it --------
#
# The step the first executed round trip could not evaluate. It ran with
# zero sessions, so nothing exercised the one file whose LOCATION the two
# versions disagree about: v0.8.1 reads session_metadata.json from
# LOG_DIRECTORY and nowhere else, while the new version resolves it
# through _resolve_state_file(), which prefers the state directory.
#
# The metadata is written by the OLD install's own code (session_meta_probe
# imports src.config from the checkout, which is at ${OLD_REF} right now),
# so the starting state is genuinely what v0.8.1 leaves behind, not this
# script's idea of it. The tmux sessions are real, on the throwaway socket.

# THE NAMES MATTER, and getting them wrong manufactures the finding.
# TmuxBackend.discover_existing() lists only ``cloude_``-prefixed names
# (SESSION_PREFIX), and the startup reconciler prunes the owned set
# against exactly that list. A first run of this step used bare names,
# so both live sessions read as dead, the owned set was pruned to empty
# and the metadata file was deleted - a perfect ABSENT verdict produced
# entirely by the fixture rather than by the product. Keep the prefix.
