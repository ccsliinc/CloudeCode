#!/bin/bash
# deploy-mini.sh - push code from this Mac to the mini, and prove it landed.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Neither install on the mini is a git checkout: the live
# one is a copied server dir inside the app bundle's support folder, and
# v1.1 is a clone that is NOT kept in sync by pulling (you develop here,
# not there). So "deploy" means copying files and restarting the right
# server, which was being done by hand, one scp at a time.
#
# TWO TARGETS, and they must never be confused:
#   live  port 8000, state ~/Library/Application Support/CloudeCode,
#         tmux socket `cloude`. This is the app you actually use.
#   v11   port 8001, state ~/Library/.../CloudeCode-v1.1,
#         tmux socket `cloude-v11`. Disposable.
#
# Default target is v11 ON PURPOSE. Deploying to live is the destructive
# one, so it must be typed.
#
# LIVE HAS TWO DESTINATIONS AND BOTH ARE MANDATORY. The packaged app
# treats Resources/src inside the bundle as authoritative and copies it
# over the server dir on every start, so a deploy that lands ONLY in the
# server dir is reverted by the next restart, including the restart this
# script issues. Measured 2026-08-29: file correct before kickstart,
# original hash after it, three times. The bundle is written FIRST, so
# that the one survivable partial state is the one we end up in if the
# second copy fails.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/deploy-mini.sh                 # -> v1.1, restart
#   ./scripts/deploy-mini.sh --target live   # -> the live install
#   ./scripts/deploy-mini.sh --all           # every tracked src/client file
#   ./scripts/deploy-mini.sh --no-restart    # copy only
#   ./scripts/deploy-mini.sh --dry-run       # print what would go
#   ./scripts/deploy-mini.sh --verify-only   # hash the target, copy nothing
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  DEPLOYED and verified
#   1  DEPLOY FAILED (transfer, copy or restart)
#   2  NOTHING DEPLOYED (no files matched; the target was NOT updated)
#   3  CANNOT DETERMINE (verification could not be evaluated)
#   4  VERIFICATION FAILED (bytes on the target do not match this Mac)
#  64  usage error
