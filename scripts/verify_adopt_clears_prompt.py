"""Prove "adopt all" makes the attribution card STOP PAINTING.

THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR. The user clicked "adopt all" and the card did
not go away. Every adopt call had succeeded - measured on his live
datastore, all five names were origin='adopted' with adopted_at stamped
at the second of the click - and the prompt endpoint re-rendered a
snapshot written at import time that could not know any of it.

WHY A PIXEL HARNESS AND NOT ANOTHER DOM TEST. "the card went away" is a
claim about what a human sees. This codebase has shipped three visibly
broken features through fully green suites: a badge that rendered the
literal string "~~claude" while every test read .textContent, a button
that fell through to the bare user-agent stylesheet as an unstyled grey
square while "the button exists" passed, and a feature carrying 282
passing state assertions that rendered zero pixels. So the closing
assertion here is a MEASURED BOX of zero painted area, taken from a real
Chromium, after a real click, against a real server.

WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS NOT. Real: the FastAPI route, the SQLite
database, the adoption write, client/js/launchpad.js, the shipped CSS,
Chromium. Not real: tmux, which is replaced by a synthetic listing
object. THIS SCRIPT NEVER OPENS A TMUX SOCKET, and in particular never
touches the user's live 'cloude' socket - the database it drives is a
throwaway under tempfile.

THE POSITIVE CONTROL IS THE BEFORE-READING. A rig that reports "nothing
is painted" and a rig that is simply broken produce identical output, so
the card is measured as a non-zero painted box BEFORE the click and the
two readings are compared. An empty result is only trusted from a rig
that has just been shown reporting a full one.

MEASUREMENT GUARDS, each from a defect that has cost this project time:
  * document.hidden is asserted FALSE and window.innerWidth is read back
    from the PAGE and compared to what was asked for. A viewport tool
    that no-ops while reporting success turns every later measurement
    into a false green generated inside the verification step itself.
  * a computed style is never read once after a guessed sleep. Readings
    are polled across two consecutive animation frames and trusted only
    once they agree, because getComputedStyle mid-transition returns the
    ANIMATED value, not the end value.

THREE OUTCOMES, and they exit differently:
  0  PASS              every assertion measured and held
  1  FAIL              something was measured and was wrong
  2  CANNOT DETERMINE  the measurement could not be taken at all
                       (playwright missing, chromium would not launch,
                       harness never became ready). Never a pass.
