"""Measure the sidebar's GROUPS, DRAG CROSSING and INLINE RENAME in a real browser.

Items 64, 65 and 66. The companion to scripts/verify_sidebar_sessions.py,
which owns density, pinning and the three-outcome blocks; this one owns
what this round added. Split rather than appended because that file is
already at the project's size budget, and because these are a different
question: not "is the list drawn right" but "does the SEAM in the list
behave".

EVERY NUMBER HERE COMES FROM getBoundingClientRect() OR getComputedStyle()
in a real Chromium. Nothing infers a box from a state object. This project
shipped 282 green state assertions over zero rendered pixels, and shipped
a double tilde that every DOM-text assertion read as correct, so a claim
about what the user sees has to be measured on what is painted.

THE DRAG IS DRIVEN WITH REAL POINTER EVENTS - mouse.move/down/up at real
coordinates taken from real rects - because "you can drag a row into the
pinned group" is a claim about what the browser does with a gesture, not
about whether a function can be called with the right arguments.

THREE OUTCOMES, and they exit differently:
  0  PASS  - every assertion measured and held
  1  FAIL  - something was measured and was wrong
  2  CANNOT DETERMINE - the measurement could not be taken at all
             (playwright missing, browser would not launch, harness never
             became ready). Never reported as a pass.
