"""Show, and optionally apply, an upgrade merge of ``config.json``.

WHAT THIS IS FOR

``config.json`` is authoritative for agent wrappers and slash commands. On
upgrade, new defaults should arrive without overwriting anything the user has
customised. Copying the new example over the top loses his edits; leaving the
file alone withholds every new default. This does the three-way merge instead,
and refuses to resolve a genuine conflict on his behalf.

DRY RUN IS THE DEFAULT. Nothing is written without ``--apply``.

THE BASE, AND WHY THE FIRST RUN IS NOISY

A three-way merge needs to know what the defaults USED to be. That record is
kept at ``<state dir>/config-base.json`` and is rewritten on every apply. The
first time this runs there is no base, so a field that differs from the new
default is genuinely ambiguous: it could be a customisation, or the default
could have moved. Those are reported as CANNOT DETERMINE rather than guessed,
his value is kept in every case, and the ambiguity disappears from then on.

BACKUPS

``--apply`` writes a timestamped copy of the current ``config.json`` into
``<state dir>/config-backups/`` before touching anything, together with a
manifest line recording the outcome. The manifest vocabulary matches
``scripts/upgrade_lib/upgrade_rollback_common.sh``: BACKED_UP, NOT_PRESENT,
MISSING, where MISSING is fatal. A backup that silently omits declared state
is worse than no backup.

Inputs:
    --config PATH      the live config.json (default: repo config.json)
    --defaults PATH    the new defaults (default: repo config.example.json)
    --state-dir PATH   override the state directory
    --apply            write the merge (default is a dry run)
    --import PATH      additionally append new upstream items to this list
                       field, for example --import common_slash_commands
    --json             emit the plan as JSON instead of text

Outputs:
    Exit 0 - merge computed (and applied when asked) with nothing needing
             attention.
    Exit 1 - a real error: unreadable config, unwritable backup.
    Exit 2 - the merge needs a human: conflicts, upstream removals, or
             undeterminable fields. Deliberately NOT exit 0, so an upgrade
             script cannot sail past it.

Example:
    ./venv/bin/python3 scripts/config_upgrade.py
    ./venv/bin/python3 scripts/config_upgrade.py --apply
