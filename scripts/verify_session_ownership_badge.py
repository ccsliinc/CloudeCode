"""Live end-to-end verification of the TMUX/EXTERNAL ownership badge.

Runs the REAL FastAPI app in-process against a DEDICATED tmux socket
(``cloudeverify``, pinned in-process below) so it cannot see or touch any
session on the app's normal ``cloude`` socket. No port is bound.

What it proves, in order:
  1. a session CREATED through POST /sessions badges owned;
  2. a session made directly in tmux and then ADOPTED badges external;
  3. opening and closing either one does not flip its badge;
  4. RESTARTING the server (a full lifespan shutdown + startup, which
     rebuilds SessionManager from disk and re-attaches through the adopt
     path) leaves both badges unchanged. That is the whole point: the
     restart is what re-mints ``adopted:`` ids for sessions we still own.

Usage:
    venv/bin/python3 scripts/verify_session_ownership_badge.py

Exits 0 and prints ALL PASS on success; 1 otherwise.
