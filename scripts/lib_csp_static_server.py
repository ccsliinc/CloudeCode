"""A static test server that stamps the APPLICATION's real security headers.

THE BLIND SPOT THIS CLOSES. Every pixel verifier under scripts/ drives
http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler rooted at the repo, because the manual
harnesses under tests/manual/ are not routes the FastAPI app serves - they
are pages that fetch the shipped markup and mount it so geometry can be
measured. That arrangement is right, and it had one structural consequence
nobody had priced in: a plain static server sends NO Content-Security-Policy,
so no CSP-dependent defect can exist in that harness. Not "usually passes" -
cannot be represented.

The codebase then proved the class is real and shippable. #logoutBtn carried
`onclick="App.logout()"` for roughly four months after `script-src 'self'`
landed. `script-src 'self'` forbids inline event handlers, so every click ran
nothing, threw nothing, rejected nothing, and left the element present, sized,
visible and unobstructed. The first harness built to chase it was a static
server and the entire logout flow worked end to end under it - correctly, for
that server, because with no CSP the inline handler is legal. A harness that
cannot reproduce the production security context cannot falsify a
security-context defect.

WHAT THIS DOES.
1. Serves `src.security_headers.SECURITY_HEADERS` on every response - the
   same dict src/main.py stamps, imported rather than copied, so the harness
   cannot drift away from production.
2. Boots harness pages anyway. `script-src 'self'` would otherwise block a
   harness's own inline bootstrap <script> and the page would never become
   ready. Each .html response gets its OWN policy in which every inline
   <script> block in THAT document is allowed by sha256 hash.
3. Refuses to grant `'unsafe-hashes'`. That is the load-bearing line in this
   file. Hashes without `'unsafe-hashes'` cover inline SCRIPT BLOCKS only;
   inline EVENT HANDLER attributes stay forbidden exactly as in production.
   So the harness boots, and the defect class still fails.

WHAT IT CANNOT DO. A CSP violation is reported to the page, not to the
server, so serving the header is only half of a check - the driving script
has to collect the violations and fail on them. Use `collector_init_script()`
and `violations()` below for that; a harness that stamps the header and never
reads the violations has changed nothing it can observe.

Usage:
    from lib_csp_static_server import serve, collector_init_script, violations
    httpd, port = serve(ROOT)
    page.add_init_script(collector_init_script())
    ...
    for v in violations(page): ...
