# Shared functions for scripts/upgrade.sh and scripts/rollback.sh. Sourced,
# never executed directly. Keeps both scripts DRY and keeps the
# three-outcome contract (pass / fail / could-not-evaluate) implemented in
# exactly one place instead of drifting between two copies.
#
# Not named scripts/lib/ - this repo's .gitignore has a generic Python
# "lib/" entry (build-artifact convention) that would silently swallow
# anything placed there. Named upgrade_lib/ instead so it is actually
# tracked; see the README's "why upgrade_lib, not lib" note if this
# surprises you.
#
# Every function documents Description / Inputs / Output per this repo's
# code-standards.md. None of them use a bare `except`-equivalent: every
# external command's exit code is checked explicitly.

# What "user state" means for a from-source install (Path B in the README).
# Split by WHERE it actually lives, verified against the app's own code
# rather than guessed:
#
#   - .env / config.json live in the install dir (AUTH_CONFIG_FILE default
#     ./config.json, .env read from cwd by both setup_auth.py and the app).
#   - config.json.bak / .update-check.json ALSO live in the install dir
#     (config_migration.py writes the former beside config.json;
#     update_check.py's default_cache_path writes the latter beside
#     repo_root() which for a from-source install IS the install dir).
#   - session_metadata.json, pinned_themes.json, unread_state.json, and
#     refresh_tokens.db do NOT live in the install dir. They live under
#     the app's STATE DIRECTORY (feat/state-directory - src/config.py's
#     Settings.get_state_dir() / get_session_metadata_path() /
#     get_pinned_themes_path() / analogous unread-state path, and
#     src/main.py's RefreshStore placement). The default, when
#     CLOUDE_STATE_DIR is unset, is
#     ``~/Library/Application Support/CloudeCode`` - a backup that skips
#     this directory entirely because it went looking in the install dir
#     would silently protect nothing. This split exists specifically so
#     that mistake is structurally impossible: the two arrays are keyed
#     by directory, not merged into one guess.
#
#     PRE feat/state-directory installs still have these files under the
#     OLD LOG_DIRECTORY-based location. resolve_state_dir() resolves only
#     the CURRENT (CLOUDE_STATE_DIR / default) DIRECTORY, matching
#     Settings.get_state_dir() exactly - that is a directory question and
#     it has one answer. Locating an individual FILE is a different
#     question with a fallback, and resolve_state_file() below is the one
#     that answers it, mirroring Settings._resolve_state_file() precedence
#     for precedence: new location wins when the file is in both, the old
#     LOG_DIRECTORY location is used when the file is only there, and the
#     new path is returned when it is in neither.
#
#     WITHOUT that fallback take_backup() aborts on a real, existing
#     install: the user's refresh_tokens.db is under the old
#     LOG_DIRECTORY, it is in STATE_DIR_REQUIRED_FILES, and the
#     directory-only resolver reports it MISSING - a hard die() on an
#     install whose data is perfectly fine and merely one directory over.
#
# A single flat list previously named every one of these as if they all
# lived in the install dir. Four of six did not: take_backup found .env
# and config.json, silently found nothing for the rest (wrong directory,
# not "absent"), and reported success anyway - a false green. See
# resolve_state_dir() and take_backup() below for the fix.
INSTALL_REQUIRED_PAIR=(".env" "config.json")          # either both exist or neither does; a half-set is a broken install
INSTALL_OPTIONAL_FILES=("config.json.bak" ".update-check.json")  # app-created lazily; absence is normal
STATE_DIR_REQUIRED_FILES=("refresh_tokens.db")          # RefreshStore.init() runs on EVERY server startup - if the server was running, this exists
STATE_DIR_OPTIONAL_FILES=("session_metadata.json" "pinned_themes.json" "unread_state.json" "cloude.db" "migration_trail.jsonl")  # created lazily on first session / theme pin / unread event; cloude.db + migration_trail.jsonl are created on the first startup that runs feat/datastore-and-trail, so they are legitimately absent on an install that has not been upgraded to it yet

# DEFAULT_PORT and resolve_port() live in scripts/resolve-port.sh - the
# single shared shell-side port resolver every port-aware script in this
# repo sources, instead of each one carrying its own copy of the "8000"
# literal. See that file's docstring for the three-outcome contract
# (resolve_port returns 1 with a stderr reason on an unparseable PORT= -
# it never silently substitutes DEFAULT_PORT for a value it could not
# parse).

# resolve_port() is sourced from scripts/resolve-port.sh (see the source
# line near the top of this file) rather than defined here.

# Description: resolve the app's state directory the SAME WAY the app
#   does - src/config.py's Settings.get_state_dir() precedence, mirrored
#   here byte-for-byte (see tests/test_state_dir_drift.py, which asserts
#   this function and get_state_dir() agree on every path for all three
#   env cases):
#     1. CLOUDE_STATE_DIR in the CURRENT PROCESS ENVIRONMENT, if set to a
#        non-empty value - takes priority, matching pydantic-settings'
#        own env-var-beats-env-file precedence for the identical field.
#     2. CLOUDE_STATE_DIR= read out of install_dir/.env, if the process
#        environment did not have it - an install-local override.
#     3. ~/Library/Application Support/CloudeCode - the macOS-native
#        default, computed via Python so "~" expands identically to the
#        app's own Path.expanduser() call (not a bash tilde trick).
#   Unlike the old resolve_log_dir() this replaces, there is ALWAYS a
#   resolvable value (the default never fails to compute) - the function
#   never returns 1. This is pure path computation, mirroring
#   get_state_dir()'s path-resolution half only; it does NOT create the
#   directory - callers that need it to exist still call mkdir -p
#   themselves, same as before.
# Inputs: $1 - install_dir (its .env is consulted only as step 2 above;
#   its absence is not an error).
# Output: prints the expanded absolute state directory path and returns 0,
#   always.

#     3. present only in the old LOG_DIRECTORY location - use it. This is
#        the case that keeps an existing install upgradable.
#     4. present in neither - return the NEW path, which is where a

#        assert that one exists.

# --- SQLite-safe copying ------------------------------------------------------
#
# A plain `cp -p` of a live SQLite database is not a safe read. WAL-mode
# SQLite (what this project uses - see src/main.py's RefreshStore) keeps
# committed-but-not-yet-checkpointed pages in a separate `-wal` file and
# reconciles them with the main `.db` file only through SQLite's own
# engine. `cp` has no idea any of that exists: it can copy the main file
# mid-checkpoint, or copy it without its `-wal` sibling at all, and the
# result is a file that passes a plain `[ -f ... ]` existence check while
# being torn or missing committed transactions. This was already a live
# risk for refresh_tokens.db (RefreshStore holds it open with an active
# purge loop) and becomes a correctness bug for the cloude.db datastore
# once that exists.
#
# The fix used throughout this file: `sqlite3 <src> "VACUUM INTO '<dst>'"`.
# VACUUM INTO reads through SQLite's own transactional/WAL-aware engine,
# so it always produces a copy of the last COMMITTED state - never a
# torn mix of pages - with no separate `-wal`/`-shm` file to lose track
# of. The copy is then verified with PRAGMA integrity_check before it is
# ever recorded BACKED_UP; see _copy_sqlite's docstring for why a bare
# `sqlite3` exit 0 is not itself proof of a usable backup.

# Description: detect whether a file is a SQLite database by its file
#   header magic ("SQLite format 3", the fixed ASCII prefix every valid
#   SQLite database file starts with) rather than by filename. Chosen
#   over an explicit filename list specifically so a future database
#   file - the cloude.db datastore named in this fix's motivating defect,
#   or anything added after it - is routed through the safe copy path
#   automatically, with nothing to remember to update here. An explicit
#   list is exactly the enumeration trap this repo's CLAUDE.md hazards
#   30/32/34 describe: a check that only knows about the names it was
#   told about silently stops covering anything renamed or added later.
# Inputs: $1 - path to a file (existence is checked here, callers do not
#   need to pre-check).
# Output: return 0 if the file exists, is non-empty, and its first 15
#   bytes are exactly "SQLite format 3". Return 1 otherwise (absent,
#   empty, or not a SQLite file) - all "not sqlite" for this check's
#   purpose; a plain cp -p is correct for those.

# Description: copy a SQLite database file the way that is actually safe
#   under a concurrent writer - `sqlite3 <src> "VACUUM INTO '<dst>'"`,
#   never `cp`. Immediately verifies the result with PRAGMA
#   integrity_check before returning success, because an sqlite3 exit
#   code of 0 is evidence that VACUUM INTO ran, not evidence that the
#   resulting file opens cleanly.
#   THREE-OUTCOME, enforced by construction: every failure path calls
#   die() itself, naming exactly which of the three things could not be
#   done (no sqlite3 binary / VACUUM INTO failed / integrity_check
#   failed), and none of them fall through to a plain `cp`. A silent
#   fallback would convert a genuine COULD-NOT-EVALUATE into a false
#   BACKED_UP - the exact defect class this project's three-outcome rule
#   (CLAUDE.md) exists to prevent, and worse here than most instances of
#   it because the thing being backed up is the one place a restore
#   would be reached for.
# Inputs: $1 - source db path (must exist and be a real SQLite file).
#   $2 - destination path (must not already exist).
# Output: exit 0 with the destination written and verified (PRAGMA
#   integrity_check returned exactly "ok"). Calls die() and never returns
#   otherwise: `sqlite3` missing from PATH, VACUUM INTO exiting non-zero,
#   or integrity_check reporting anything other than "ok" (the partial
#   destination file is deleted first in that last case, so it can never
#   be mistaken for a usable backup by a later restore).

#   array comments above resolve_state_dir). SQLite databases
#   (refresh_tokens.db today, cloude.db once it exists) are routed through
#   _copy_sqlite (VACUUM INTO + integrity_check), never a raw file copy -
#   see the "SQLite-safe copying" note above this function for why.
#   Everything else is copied with cp -p, which is a genuinely safe plain
#   read for whole-file text/JSON writers. Correct to call whether or not
#   the server is still running, but scripts/upgrade.sh and
#   scripts/rollback.sh both call it AFTER stop_service anyway: a copy
#   against a quiesced writer is simpler to reason about and faster
#   (VACUUM INTO against an idle database has nothing to reconcile),
#   even though it is not the thing that makes the copy correct.
# Inputs: $1 - install_dir. $2 - backup_dir (must not already exist).
# Output: prints the backup_dir on stdout for the caller to surface
#   prominently. Exits via die() if: backup_dir already exists; it cannot
#   be created; any BACKED_UP copy fails; INSTALL_REQUIRED_PAIR is
#   half-present (one of .env/config.json exists, the other does not - a
#   broken install, not a legitimate state); or any STATE_DIR_REQUIRED_FILES
#   entry is missing while the install is configured (refresh_tokens.db is
#   created by every server startup, so its absence on a configured,
#   presumably-just-stopped install means something is already wrong and a
#   backup here would be incomplete).

#   "install" category, the CURRENTLY-configured state directory for the
#   "state" category. Restores install files FIRST so CLOUDE_STATE_DIR can
#   be read from the just-restored .env before any state file is placed.
#   Does NOT run config migration afterward - the whole point of a
#   rollback is that the restored config matches the OLDER code being
#   checked out alongside it.
#   Uses plain cp -p, unlike take_backup's _copy_backup_file - and that is
#   correct here, not an oversight: scripts/rollback.sh (the only caller)
#   invokes this after stop_service, so the destination has no writer, and
#   the source is a static file inside an already-closed backup directory
#   that nothing is writing to either. Neither side of this copy has the
#   live-writer hazard _copy_sqlite exists to close, so there is nothing
#   for VACUUM INTO to buy here.
# Inputs: $1 - install_dir. $2 - backup_dir (must exist and have a
#   .manifest produced by take_backup).
# Output: prints the number of files restored on stdout. Exits via die()
#   if backup_dir or its manifest is missing, a BACKED_UP install file's
#   restore copy fails, or (once install files are back) the state
#   directory cannot be resolved while the manifest has BACKED_UP state
#   entries to place, or any of those copies fail. A failure partway
#   leaves install_dir in a MIXED state - reported loudly, never
