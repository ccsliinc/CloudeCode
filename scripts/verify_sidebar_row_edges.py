"""Is the thick left bar actually gone from every sidebar row.

The report was "also the border on the sidebar. get rid of the thick left
bar like on the homepage and clean it like the homepage looks now".

THREE stylesheets painted a left-side colour bar on a sidebar row, and
they are not the same bar:
  session-sidebar-density.css  `[data-pinned="1"]` drew inset 2px accent
  session-theme-tint.css       `[data-session-theme]` drew inset 3px in
                               the SESSION's accent, plus a 1px ring
  (nothing)                    `[data-active="1"]` never drew one - it is
                               an accent background, an accent 1px border
                               on all four sides, and a bold accent name
The 3px session-theme rail is the one that was on screen: the green
outline reported on `cloude_console-msw4z3m5` is that rule with a green
`--session-theme-accent`, and the orange 3px + 1px pair measured on the
current row is the SAME rule with an orange one. Neither was the active
state. All the rails are now gone; the 1px session-theme ring stays,
because it is the row's identity on all four edges rather than a bar, and
every row now carries the home screen's own `1px solid var(--color-border)`
so the dense list still separates.

WHY THIS IS A PIXEL TEST AND NOT A RULE-TEXT TEST. A grep can prove a
declaration was deleted. It cannot prove nothing else paints that edge,
and this repo has shipped three features that were visibly broken while
their suites were fully green, because the assertions read markup: a pill
that rendered `~~claude` while `.textContent` was checked, a button that
fell through to the bare user-agent stylesheet while "the button exists"
passed, and a feature with 282 passing assertions that rendered no pixels
at all. So every verdict below comes from screenshotting real pixels in a
real Chromium that loaded the real stylesheets in the shipped order.

THE CENTRAL ASSERTION IS SYMMETRY, and it is deliberately not a
comparison against any token. For each row, the pixels one, two and three
in from the LEFT edge must match the pixels one, two and three in from
the RIGHT edge. A left bar of ANY width beyond the border, in ANY colour,
from ANY stylesheet, breaks that - including one nobody has written yet.
Comparing the left edge against `--color-accent` would only catch the two
rails that exist today, and would go green the moment a new one used a
different token.

FIVE ROWS, because each rail came from a different rule and one row can
only ever prove one of them - plus `pinned + themed`, the combination
where the pinned rail was ALREADY being silently replaced: both rules
match at the same specificity and the tint sheet loads later, so it
overwrote `box-shadow` outright and a pinned themed row had no pinned
rail at all. That is why the pinned rail is not merely redundant, it was
unreliable.

TWO PALETTES, terminal and codex, chosen far apart in both directions
that matter: a black page against a light one, and `--color-border` at
#2B2B2B against #e5e5ea. The run REQUIRES the measured border pixel to
CHANGE between them, which is what turns "matches a token" into "follows
the theme". gameboy and matrix are deliberately not used: they set
several status tokens to one value, so rows are indistinguishable there
and a run could pass for the wrong reason.

TWO POSITIVE CONTROLS, one per verdict.
  #control-rail paints a 3px inset rail on purpose, so a sampler that
  could only ever say "left matches right" fails there instead of passing
  every row for the wrong reason.
  The active-versus-plain check is the other direction: it requires two
  pixels to DIFFER, so a sampler stuck on "everything differs" cannot
  satisfy the symmetry checks and this one at the same time.

THREE OUTCOMES, and they exit differently:
  0  PASS  - every row measured, no left bar anywhere, active still
             distinguishable, session identity still on screen
  1  FAIL  - something was measured and was wrong
  2  CANNOT DETERMINE - the measurement could not be taken at all
             (playwright missing, browser would not launch, harness never
             became ready, tab reported itself hidden, a theme manifest
             would not load, a row missing from the harness). Never a
             pass.

playwright is not importable under this project's venv. Run it with an
