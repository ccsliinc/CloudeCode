"""Collapse the gate's findings into the queue a human would actually work.

WHY A SECOND GROUPING. message_model_corpus_report.py groups each
condition by its own natural review unit - a file, a uuid, a record type.
That is already far smaller than the raw row count, and it is still not
the number that decides whether the gate is usable, because most of those
items share ONE cause. 908 of 909 unrootable sessions are subagent
transcripts whose root lives in the parent session file: that is one
decision about how the root check is scoped, not 908 files to read. This
module reports the cause classes and how much of the queue each one
absorbs, so the owner can see which single decisions retire which blocks
of the queue.

EVERY CLASS IS MEASURED, NOT ASSERTED. Each class below is a query that
runs against the finished database and prints its own count. Nothing here
is a rule of thumb about what the data probably looks like.

THE RESIDUE IS THE POINT. The last number printed is what is left once
every recognised cause is subtracted - the items that genuinely need a
human to look at a specific record. If that residue is small the gate is
usable as a review queue; if it is large it is not, and either number is
a real finding rather than a failure.
