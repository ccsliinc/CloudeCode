"""The wizard must actually RENDER, not merely populate a DOM.

WHY A SEPARATE FILE, AND WHY IT DRIVES A REAL BROWSER

This codebase has shipped three visible defects through green suites in one
week: a feature with 282 passing state assertions that drew zero pixels, a
badge that rendered the literal text "~~claude" while every test read
.textContent and saw both tildes as legitimately present, and a button that
fell through to the bare user-agent stylesheet because it carried no class,
while the assertion "the button exists" passed because the element genuinely
was in the DOM.

The lesson each of those taught is the same one: textContent proves the DOM is
right and proves nothing about what a human sees. So the assertions here are
measurements taken from a real Chromium - bounding rectangles, computed
styles, and painted pixels sampled off a screenshot - chosen so that each one
fails on a defect a human would notice and could not be satisfied by markup
alone.

THE TRAPS THIS FILE AVOIDS ON PURPOSE

* Every measurement asserts ``!document.hidden`` first. A backgrounded tab
  freezes its render loop, which silently breaks bounding rects, transitions
  and paint - a false failure manufactured inside the verification step.
* Viewport width is asserted from ``window.innerWidth``, never trusted from
  whatever set it. A resize call that reports success and no-ops has cost this
  project several rounds already.
* Nothing sleeps a guessed interval and reads once. Where a value could still
  be animating, it is polled across two consecutive animation frames and only
  accepted once they agree.

If Playwright or its Chromium is unavailable, these tests SKIP with that
reason stated. A skip is the third outcome; it is not a pass, and the skip
message says so rather than letting an unmeasured run look green.
