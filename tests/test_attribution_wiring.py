"""S7 - the WIRING that feeds the attribution rule, and the cwd probe.

Split out of tests/test_project_attribution.py, which keeps the RULE.
The split follows the bug rather than the file: the rule was never
broken, and no amount of testing it would have found the defect. What
was broken is that nothing ever handed it a working directory, so this
file tests the collection path - the tmux probe, the import call site,
and the backfill that repairs rows the one-way import already froze.

WHY THE PROBE TESTS DRIVE REAL TMUX. A mocked subprocess agrees with
whatever argv the probe happens to build, including a broken one - and
the argv is where this actually went wrong. The first version of the
probe asked for ``#{session_path}`` with the target ``=<name>``, which
returns an EMPTY STRING on tmux 3.7b, because display-message's ``-t``
is a target-PANE and ``=<name>`` asks for an exact pane of that name.
Every probe in production would have answered nothing, every row would
have stayed ``unknown``, and a mock would have passed. Found by the
mutation suite, fixed to ``=<name>:``, and pinned by the tests below.

Every tmux call here runs against THIS run's isolated socket, which
``tests/socket_guard.py`` enforces - no live session is reachable.
