"""Regressions for the schema-version read and the trail's interrupt
labelling (findings V5 and V7 of the second adversarial round).

Both are the same defect shape: a THIRD outcome collapsed onto one of the
other two, inside the machinery whose entire job is to be trustworthy
about what happened.

  V5  ``get_schema_version`` reported an unparseable value as ``0``, and
      the backup gate is ``if current > 0``. So a populated 9-project
      database whose ``meta.schema_version`` said ``''``, ``'v1'``,
      ``'1.0'`` or ``'3-dirty'`` migrated with ZERO backups taken, and
      the trail recorded it as a ``bootstrap`` from 0 - a false claim
      about a live database, written into the file that exists to be the
      honest history.
  V7  ``_prior_interrupt_uuid`` matched any earlier line with
      ``status=='started'``, which includes the opening line of an
      attempt that later closed cleanly as ``failed``. A retry after a
      clean failure then recorded ``completed_after_interrupt`` and
      asserted an interrupt that never happened.

The V5 tests run against a database shaped like the user's REAL one -
schema v1, populated projects table - because that is the actual
production upgrade path, not an edge case.
