"""The one-way import latch, and the failed probe that must never stamp it.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, IN ONE PARAGRAPH.
``meta.imported_from_json_at`` is stamped once and never cleared, over an
input that disappears: the live tmux process list. If the tmux probe fails
and the latch is stamped anyway, the import writes zero sessions, marks
itself complete forever, and the user boots to an empty RECENT list with
no error on any screen. His history is gone and nothing will ever retry.
That is the single most dangerous line in the whole datastore design, and
these tests are the thing standing on it.

TWO KINDS OF ASSERTION HERE, DELIBERATELY.
  BEHAVIOURAL - feed a failed listing, prove nothing was written and the
    latch is unset, then prove a later successful run completes.
  STRUCTURAL  - walk the module's AST and prove there is exactly ONE
    stamp site and that it is unreachable from the failed-probe branch.
The behavioural test only covers the paths it happens to exercise. The
structural one covers the edit somebody makes next year.
