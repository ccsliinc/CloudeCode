"""The setup wizard's auth gate and the bind lockdown that makes it safe.

WHY THIS FILE IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS

A bug in the merge report is a bad afternoon. A bug here is a stranger on the
LAN reaching an unauthenticated page that sets the TOTP secret, which is a
remote takeover of the machine this software runs terminals on.

So the tests are written from the attacker's side. The easy direction - "an
unconfigured instance lets the wizard load" - is asserted, but it is the weak
half: a gate that is broken OPEN passes it too. The half that carries the
weight is the other one, that a CONFIGURED instance genuinely refuses an
unauthenticated caller, and the invariant test below, which asserts across
every reachable state that an open wizard and an off-host bind never coexist.

``scripts/ci/mutate-setup-auth-gate.sh`` inverts the gate in five distinct
ways and requires this file to fail on each, so "these tests pass" is backed by
evidence that they can fail.
