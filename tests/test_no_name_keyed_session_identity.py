"""Structural guard: no NEW sessions-row identity lookup keyed on tmux
name alone.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Four separate bugs shipped in one week, all one
class: something decided WHICH sessions row a live tmux pane IS, or which
row to write durable state onto, using the tmux NAME as the key -

  * the home screen joined live sessions to stored rows by name (a
    running session VANISHED from its project)
  * activity state was written to every row sharing a name (a dead row
    got the live row's status)
  * the client and server derived a display name from a tmux name by
    different rules
  * fork resolution and identity_for_live_name still pick a row by name
    today

A tmux NAME is not durable identity. tmux recycles names the moment a
session is recreated after its pane dies, so two SESSIONS - two different
rows, two different histories - can legitimately share one name. The
durable keys in this schema are ``sessions.id`` / ``session_uuid``, the
INSTANCE TRIPLE (``tmux_socket``, ``tmux_name``, ``tmux_created_epoch``),
and ``claude_session_uuid``. Each of the four bugs above picked a row by
name and then treated the result as if it were keyed on one of those.

Fixing the four instances does not close the class. Nothing stops a fifth
call site from doing the exact same thing next week. This is that stop.

WHAT COUNTS AS A VIOLATION. This file scans every ``*.execute(...)`` call
in ``src/`` whose literal SQL text:

  1. touches the ``sessions`` table (``FROM sessions`` or
     ``UPDATE sessions`` - never ``session_group_members``, a different
     table with its own, separately registered problem - see below), AND
  2. filters its WHERE clause on ``tmux_name = ?``, AND
  3. does NOT also filter on an EXACT ``tmux_created_epoch = ?`` value.

(3) is the line that actually separates safe from unsafe. A query that
requires ``tmux_created_epoch = <a specific value>`` is keyed on the
INSTANCE TRIPLE, which is durable identity - a name is only ever the
first half of the key. A query that merely checks
``tmux_created_epoch IS NOT NULL`` and then takes the newest row
(``ORDER BY tmux_created_epoch DESC ... LIMIT 1``) is NOT keyed on the
triple: it is keyed on the name, with recency used as a heuristic
tiebreak. That heuristic is exactly the bug - "the most recent session
with this name" is a guess, not a fact, the moment two sessions have
shared the name.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ALLOWED, and does not need an entry in the
exemption list at all because it never matches the pattern above:

  * rendering a name to a human (no SQL involved)
  * a tmux CLI call that addresses a session by name (tmux has no other
    handle - this file only looks at ``sessions`` table SQL)
  * a listing/candidate-set query with no ``tmux_name = ?`` equality
    filter at all (e.g. ``session_lifecycle.py``'s
    ``_running_candidates``, which scans every running row on a socket
    for further per-row reconciliation - it is not picking THE row for
    a name)
  * a query keyed on an EXACT epoch value
    (``tmux_created_epoch = ?``) - the whole ``session_import_promote.py``
    module is this shape throughout, which is why nothing in it appears
    below despite an earlier draft of this task's brief expecting a
    finding at line ~61: verified against the live file, every WHERE
    clause there pins an exact epoch, so it is not a name-only key at
    all and does not belong in the exemption list. Registering it
    anyway would be dead weight - an exemption for a site that was never
    a violation, which is exactly the kind of furniture this repo's own
    hazard list warns against.

WHAT IS **NOT** ALLOWED, and needs a registered exemption with a reason:
selecting or updating a ``sessions`` row by name in order to establish
IDENTITY - to decide which row a live session IS, or which row to write
durable state onto. Every current instance is below, verified against
the live file at the time this guard was written; NONE of them is fixed
by this file. This is a guard, not a fix.

THE GROUP MEMBERSHIP TABLE. ``session_group_members`` has
``tmux_name TEXT PRIMARY KEY`` (``src/core/db_models.py``,
``DDL_SESSION_GROUP_MEMBERS``) - a SCHEMA asserting that an ephemeral
name IS an identity, which is an enforced INCORRECT contract and worse
than no contract at all. This file does not attempt to fix it (that is a
migration and a design decision about what a group should key on,
neither of which belongs in a guard test). It is a different table from
``sessions`` and is therefore outside the query-pattern scan above by
construction; ``test_group_membership_primary_key_is_a_known_bad_contract``
below exists solely so this fact stays VISIBLE rather than quietly
passing every run with nobody looking at it.
