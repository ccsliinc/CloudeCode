"""Every script the app INVOKES by path must be DELIVERED to the tree it invokes it from.

Why this file exists
--------------------
``nuke.sh`` shipped in the .app bundle but was deliberately left out of
``RESYNC_ALLOWLIST`` in ``macOS/bootstrap.js``, on the theory that a user
might have customized their copy. The consequence was that a first-run copy
landed once and then never moved again, while ``macOS/main.js`` kept executing
``path.join(serverManager.getProjectRoot(), 'nuke.sh')`` - the DERIVED tree.
So a fresh install got the new uninstaller and every UPGRADE got the new
typed-NUKE confirmation window wired to the OLD destructive script: the one
that missed the state directory and left ``cloude.db`` and
``refresh_tokens.db`` on disk while reporting a full reset.

That is worse than either half alone, because it looks fixed.

What this file asserts, and why it is DERIVED
---------------------------------------------
A hardcoded list of filenames rots the moment somebody adds a script. So the
three inputs here are all READ OUT OF THE SOURCE:

  1. INVOKED  - every script name the running app builds a path to against
                its own root and hands to a spawn/exec, scraped from
                ``macOS/*.js`` and ``src/**/*.py``.
  2. BUNDLED  - ``build.extraResources`` in ``macOS/package.json``: what
                physically ships inside the .app.
  3. RESYNCED - ``RESYNC_ALLOWLIST`` in ``macOS/bootstrap.js``: what is
                refreshed into the derived tree on every packaged launch.

A script added tomorrow is caught without anyone remembering to update this
test, because it enters INVOKED by being invoked.

THREE OUTCOMES, not two
-----------------------
A script that is invoked but not resynced is not automatically a pass or a
fail. There is a third state - "invoked, deliberately not delivered, and the
caller handles its absence LOUDLY" - and it is recorded in
``ACCEPTED_UNDELIVERED`` with a reason. That register is not a mute button:
an entry is only legal if the script is ALSO absent from ``extraResources``,
i.e. the app never pretends to ship it. The nuke.sh failure mode - shipped,
stale, executed anyway, silently wrong - can never be parked there.
