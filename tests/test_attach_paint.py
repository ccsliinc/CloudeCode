"""The screen must paint on FIRST attach and on RE-ATTACH.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: commit ``a9cd2f9`` made ``capture_scrollback``
return empty for alternate-screen panes. That was correct in isolation -
replaying frozen alt-screen bytes at a new geometry paints shrapnel - but
the ATTACH path depended on that same capture to paint anything at all,
so every fullscreen session opened BLANK and the change had to be rolled
back to ``9248f5d``. No test caught it, because every existing test
around this code asserts on the strategy NAME the paint path chose, and
the strategy was still "correct"; what changed was whether any bytes
reached the client.

So these assertions are about BYTES AND PANE STATE, against a real tmux
server on a THROWAWAY socket, never the user's:

  - a fullscreen (alternate-screen) pane is detected as such, and the
    attach path redraws it by writing Ctrl+L to the pane, which is the
    only thing that can repaint a TUI at the current geometry;
  - a normal-screen pane is painted by sending the client a capture, and
    that capture is NON-EMPTY and contains what is on screen;
  - a second attach (the reconnect case, which on a phone is the common
    one) behaves identically to the first - this is the half a paint bug
    hides in, because the first attach usually still has the session
    creation path behind it;
  - ``capture_scrollback`` still returns bytes for BOTH pane types, which
    is the exact invariant ``a9cd2f9`` broke.
