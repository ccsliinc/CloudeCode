"""fix/real-app-icon — regression test for every icon asset the app declares.

Guards against exactly the bug class this branch fixed: a `<link>` or
manifest `icons[]` entry pointing at a filename that has been renamed or
deleted, which 404s silently (nobody watches the network tab of their own
home-screen icon). Checks two independent things for every declared icon:

1. The path referenced in client/index.html, client/manifest.webmanifest and
   the header-icon constant in client/js/app.js resolves to a file that
   actually exists on disk.
2. The exact same URL, requested through a minimal Starlette app that mounts
   client/ the same way src/main.py does (StaticFiles at /static, plus the
   two dedicated /manifest.webmanifest and /apple-touch-icon.png routes),
   returns HTTP 200.

Deliberately does NOT import src.main / boot the real app: that pulls in
session_manager's lifespan (tmux, auth config, upload sweeper) for no
benefit here. The route shapes under test are exactly two lines of
src/main.py (the StaticFiles mount + the apple-touch-icon FileResponse) and
are cheap to mirror directly.

Hermetic - no server process, no config.json, no network.

# fix/icon-consistency — regression tests for the header-icon-as-emoji bug.
#
# The bug this section guards against was never a missing/404 asset (the
# section above already covers that class). The SVG was correct and served
# with a 200 the entire time. The bug was that client/js/app.js only wrote
# the real <img> into #header-icon when called with opts.icon === 'cloude'
# (the terminal/session screen); every other screen — auth, launchpad/home —
# got a literal cloud EMOJI written over the top instead, because the static
# HTML in client/index.html shipped that emoji as the element's initial
# content and setHeaderIdentity() re-asserted it on every non-'cloude' call.
#
# A test that only checks the asset resolves (as every test above does)
# cannot catch this class: the asset was always fine. These tests instead
# assert on the SOURCE that decides which one gets drawn:
#   1. the static markup's initial content is the real <img>, not the emoji
#   2. that <img>'s src matches HEADER_BRAND_ICON_URL (single source of truth)
#   3. setHeaderIdentity()'s body no longer branches the emoji in based on
#      opts.icon — HEADER_BRAND_EMOJI must not appear inside it at all
#   4. every screen-entry function that owns the header calls
#      setHeaderIdentity() at all (a screen that never calls it is invisible
#      to every other check here)
