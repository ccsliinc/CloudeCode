"""Regression proofs for D5 to D8 of the S4 adversarial review.

The IMPORT path: the origin it assigns, the two keys of its once-only
latch, the socket it records, and what it does with a latch record it
cannot read.

D1, D2 and D3 are proved in tests/test_tmux_listing_parse.py and
tests/test_s4_regressions.py. The AST half of D6 is proved in
tests/test_session_import.py, next to the check it replaces.

Each test names its defect and asserts the failure CANNOT RECUR. Where
the risk is a future EDIT rather than a future input, the proof is
structural: a behavioural test only fails on cases somebody thought of.
