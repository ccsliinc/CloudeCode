"""Drift test for docs/session-project-operations.md.

WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
    The chart is a set of claims about code. This test proves every symbol
    and route the chart NAMES still resolves. It does NOT prove the arrows
    between them are right - no mechanical test can, and pretending
    otherwise would be exactly the false green the chart's own three-outcome
    section warns about.

    So: a green run means the chart's vocabulary is real. It means nothing
    about whether the chart's story is still true. A rename, a deleted
    route or a moved helper turns this RED, which is the whole point - the
    chart fails the build instead of quietly becoming fiction.

THE CITATION GRAMMAR, WHICH THE DOCUMENT DECLARES IN ITS OWN HEADER
    path/to/file.py::symbol   - that file defines that symbol
    path/to/file.js::symbol   - that file defines that function or method
    METHOD /route             - some router under src/api/ declares it

    A citation with no double colon and no leading method is not a
    citation; prose is free to mention a filename without being held to it.

WHY A MODULE PATH WITH NO SYMBOL IS ALSO CHECKED
    The chart cites a few modules as a whole - src/core/project_presence.py,
    for instance. Those are held to "the file exists", which is the only
    claim being made.

THREE OUTCOMES
    A citation resolves, a citation provably does not resolve, or the
    document could not be read at all. The third is its own failure with
    its own message; reporting "no broken citations" for a document that
    was never opened is the defect this file exists to prevent.
