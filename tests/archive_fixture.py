"""Throwaway archive databases for the archive browse tests.

Every archive test builds its own database in a pytest ``tmp_path``. The
real corpus is never opened by the suite: it is 11 GB, it is the owner's
complete working record, and a test that reads it would be measuring
whatever happens to be in it today rather than the condition it was
written to catch.

The seeders below take explicit arguments for the things the tests care
about - a NULL ``project_id``, an ``ingested_at`` tie, a
``cannot_determine`` attribution, a body with no appearance body_id - so
each test states the shape it needs instead of inheriting a blob of
setup and hoping.
