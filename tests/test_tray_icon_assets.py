"""Pixel-level checks on the generated menu-bar tray icons.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS

Two defects in this feature were invisible to every non-pixel check.

1. THE MARK MUST NOT BE REDRAWN. The status icons are built by compositing
   the shipped mark, never by re-tracing it. Nothing about a filename or a
   file size can tell you whether somebody quietly redrew the silhouette, so
   the test compares the generated icons' opaque region against the SOURCE
   asset's opaque region directly.

2. THE HEALTHY STATE MUST NOT LOOK LIKE THE STOPPED ONE. The first version of
   this feature left "ok" on AppKit's template-image path while the dotted
   states used the ordinary image path. The two paths render at different
   weights, and measured in a real menu bar the healthy glyph came out at p90
   luminance 70 while "stopped" came out at 78 - the stopped server was
   BRIGHTER than the healthy one, and the two were indistinguishable at a
   glance. Every unit test passed the whole time, because nothing compared
   the actual pixels of one state against another.

These assertions run on the generated PNGs, so they fail if somebody edits
the generator's constants without looking at the result.
