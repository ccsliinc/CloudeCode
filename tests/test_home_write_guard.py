"""The test suite must not be able to write outside a temp directory.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
``src/main.py``'s lifespan called ``claude_hooks.ensure_hook_settings()``
with no path argument. The function fell back to
``Path.home() / ".claude" / "settings.json"``, so a plain ``pytest`` run
merged CloudeCode's managed hook block into the DEVELOPER'S OWN live
Claude Code configuration. Nothing failed, nothing warned: the write
succeeded, which is the worst shape a defect can take.

An autouse fixture that redirects the path is not sufficient on its own.
A test that constructs its own app, imports the writer directly, or runs
in a subprocess can bypass a fixture and silently re-open the hole. So
the guarantee lives in THREE layers and this file exercises all of them:

1. ``claude_hooks.ensure_hook_settings`` no longer has an implicit
   default. A caller must decide, in writing, which file it means.
2. ``src/core/test_write_guard.py`` refuses, at the moment of the write,
   any path outside a temp directory while a test run is in progress.
   That is what catches a caller who decides wrong.
3. ``tests/conftest.py`` points the production default at a temp file so
   the ordinary path is safe as well as guarded.

THE THREE-OUTCOME RULE
----------------------
The guard has three verdicts, not two: allowed (provably under a temp
root), refused (provably outside one), and refused-because-undetermined
(the temp root itself could not be resolved). "I could not tell where
this write would land" is the exact state the original defect hid in, so
it is a refusal, never a pass.
