"""Containment tests for the upload sweeper - the only DESTRUCTIVE write site.

WHY A SEPARATE FILE FROM ``test_upload_sweeper.py``
--------------------------------------------------
That file tests what the sweeper DOES. This one tests what it must
REFUSE to do. They fail for different reasons and are read by different
people: a break here means the blast radius of a delete has grown, not
that TTL arithmetic drifted.

HOW EVERY DESTRUCTIVE ASSERTION HERE IS AIMED
---------------------------------------------
Two rules, both learned the hard way:

1. **Assert on the filesystem, never on the call.** A test proving
   ``unlink`` was invoked with the right argument proves nothing about
   what survived. Every check below seeds a real tree, runs the real
   sweep, and then asks the filesystem what is still there.

2. **A destructive test must never be able to cause the incident it
   tests for.** If a test called the real pruner with a real project
   path, then neutering the guard would make the test PERFORM the damage
   it exists to prevent - the failing assertion runs after the delete.
   So every call that can delete is aimed at a disposable tree under
   ``tmp_path``, and the verdict for a real, non-disposable path is read
   through ``sweep_verdict()``, which is a pure query that mutates
   nothing.

   The "outside a temp root" case is arranged by narrowing what the
   guard CONSIDERS a temp root (monkeypatching ``temp_roots``) rather
   than by widening what the test writes to. The guard logic under test
   is the real one; only the disposable tree is at stake.
