"""The sidebar row's INLINE CONTROLS, measured in a real browser.

The owner folded the row's action icons into a three-dot overflow menu in
cddc823, then unfolded them again on 2026-09-08: "move the pin and close
icons back to the inline icons. remove 'add to group' / 'restart the
agent' and the three dots now that they're not needed."

So this file, which used to measure the menu, measures the two controls
that replaced it. It is a rewrite of the same harness rather than a new
one, because the harness is the expensive part and none of it changed:
the real stylesheets, the real row builder, the real click router, a
phone viewport and a touch pointer.

WHY A BROWSER AND NOT THE SANDBOX. Its sibling
``tests/test_session_row_inline_controls.node.mjs`` pins the DEFINITION -
which builder each control comes from, that no label is written twice,
that a live row is offered no restart. Everything below needs a real
cascade and a real hit test instead:

* the TAP TARGET is half real width and half a transparent ``::after``
  overlay under ``(pointer: coarse)``, which is a media query nothing but
  a browser evaluates, and an overlay a ``getBoundingClientRect`` on the
  button cannot see at all;
* two controls now sit SIDE BY SIDE where one used to sit alone, so
  whether either one steals the other's taps is an ``elementFromPoint``
  question and nothing else;
* whether the NAME still has room at 330px is arithmetic over real
  measured widths after a real ellipsis;
* whether the drag grip is still grabbable is a hit test against the
  element the pointer handlers are bound to;
* and a glyph that failed to paint looks identical to one that painted,
  from the DOM. Only an ink count over a screenshot separates them.

THE TRAPS THIS FILE AVOIDS ON PURPOSE

* Every measurement asserts ``document.hidden is False`` first. A
  backgrounded tab freezes rAF and leaves transitions at currentTime 0,
  which manufactures a false result inside the verification step.
* Presence is never accepted as rendering. The decisive checks are a
  ``getBoundingClientRect``, a ``getComputedStyle``, an
  ``elementFromPoint`` hit test, and an INK COUNT over a real screenshot.
* Nothing sleeps a guessed interval and reads once.
* The REMOVED menu is asserted absent by hit test as well as by count,
  because a panel mounted on ``document.body`` would not be inside the
  row and a row-scoped count would miss it entirely.

If Playwright or its Chromium is unavailable these tests SKIP, and the
skip says the rendering was NOT measured. A skip is the third outcome; it
is not a pass.
