"""The migration driver, against real SQLite files. No mocks.

THE TEST THAT MATTERS MOST is test_half_applied_migration_rolls_back, and
its follow-on retry. Everything else in this subsystem is arrangement
around one question: when the process dies between two ALTERs, does the
database end up half-changed while the version claims the change landed?

The rest of the file walks the four could-not-evaluate states and proves
each is reported as ITSELF - not as ok, not as each other:

  * an unreadable trail PAUSES migration and boots on ground truth,
  * an unopenable database is read-only and says so,
  * an unverifiable backup aborts before touching anything live,
  * a schema version ahead of this code refuses to write and names both
    numbers.
