# tests/test_upgrade_backup.sh - tests for take_backup / restore_backup /
# resolve_state_dir / _copy_sqlite / _is_sqlite_file in
# scripts/upgrade_lib/upgrade_rollback_common.sh, plus the backup-vs-
# stop_service call ordering in scripts/upgrade.sh and scripts/rollback.sh.
#
# Plain bash test (no pytest bridge exists for these functions - they are
# bash, not Python). Run directly: ./tests/test_upgrade_backup.sh
# Exits 0 if every case passes, 1 on the first failure, printing which.
#
# Covers the three-outcome contract for backup/restore:
# - a file that lives in CLOUDE_STATE_DIR (not the install dir) is actually
#     found and backed up there - the exact bug a design review caught:
#     the original implementation looked in the wrong directory for four
#     of six declared files and silently reported success.
# - a declared-but-missing REQUIRED file (refresh_tokens.db) makes
#     take_backup die, not warn.
# - a legitimately-absent OPTIONAL file (never pinned a theme) is
#     recorded as NOT_PRESENT and does not fail the backup.
# - restore puts every file back exactly where the app reads it from,
#     verified with cmp, not just "the copy didn't error".
#
# Cases 5+ cover the SQLite-safe-copy fix (backup-ordering-sqlite):
# - a WAL-mode SQLite database with an uncommitted, still-open write
#     transaction backs up to a copy that passes integrity_check AND
#     reflects the COMMITTED row count, never the uncommitted one.
# - a plain `cp -p` of a WAL-mode database whose commits have not yet
#     been checkpointed into the main file loses those commits entirely
#     (they live only in the -wal sibling cp never touches) - proving
#     the test can actually tell `cp` and `VACUUM INTO` apart, not just
#     asserting a truism.
# - removing sqlite3 from PATH makes the backup ABORT, never fall back
#     to cp.
# - a copy that fails integrity_check is never recorded BACKED_UP.
# - scripts/upgrade.sh calls stop_service before take_backup (and
#     scripts/rollback.sh calls stop_service before restore_backup).
