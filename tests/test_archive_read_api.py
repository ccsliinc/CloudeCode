"""Tests for ``/api/v1/archive/*`` (the message browser route layer).

WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT. The core modules
have their own suites for query correctness, keyset walking and secret
withholding. This file asserts the ROUTE LAYER's four standing promises,
each of which is invisible in code review and each of which has bitten a
real project:

1. **Auth, against a real request.** A route registered on the wrong
   router looks identical in review. Every route is called with no
   credentials and must answer 401.
2. **``response_model is None`` on every route**, asserted by walking
   ``router.routes``. A FastAPI response model is a FILTER: it silently
   deletes any field it does not declare, which is exactly what would
   happen to ``unevaluated`` and ``meta``. A structural test is the only
   thing that stops a route added next month from reintroducing it.
3. **Every 200 carries a ``result_status`` from the permitted set.** An
   empty ``result`` means three different things depending on it.
4. **A malformed cursor is a 400 ``cannot_determine``, never a page-1
   reset.** A client that silently restarts renders duplicates forever
   and never finishes, and raises no error for anyone to see.

The fixture database is BUILT HERE, from the real migration, and is
deliberately tiny. THE REAL CORPUS IS NEVER OPENED by anything in this
file - not read, not copied, not pointed at.
