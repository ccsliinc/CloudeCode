"""The restart picker, measured in a real browser at phone width.

The owner asked to pick a wrapper when a session is restarted. The
dangerous half of granting that is the respawn ladder's ``shell`` rung: a
pane whose ``#{pane_start_command}`` is empty comes back as a LOGIN SHELL
rather than an agent, silently. So the picker's job is to SAY SO before
anything is spawned, and whether it says so is a question about pixels,
not about a variable.

WHY A BROWSER AND NOT THE SANDBOX. Its sibling
``tests/test_restart_picker.node.mjs`` pins the DEFINITION - which rungs
are actionable, that the baseline option leads, that an unreadable
wrapper list is not an empty one. Everything below needs a real cascade
and a real hit test instead:

* the three predicted outcomes must not LOOK the same. That is a computed
  ``color`` off ``client/css/session-restart-picker.css``, not a class
  name, and a stylesheet that failed to load would leave all three
  identical while every DOM assertion still passed;
* a disabled restart button has to be genuinely unclickable, which is an
  ``elementFromPoint`` hit test plus a click that must produce no call;
* the panel has to FIT on a 390px phone with three options in it, which
  is arithmetic over real measured widths;
* and the option rows have to clear a thumb, which is a measured height.

TRAPS AVOIDED ON PURPOSE, the same ones as
``tests/test_session_row_menu_renders.py``:

* NOTHING RE-RUNS AN INIT to see whether it ran. The picker is opened
  once per test through its real entry point.
* Every measurement asserts ``document.hidden is False`` first, because a
  backgrounded tab freezes rAF and manufactures a false result inside the
  verification step itself.
* Presence is never accepted as rendering. The decisive checks are
  ``getBoundingClientRect``, ``getComputedStyle`` and an
  ``elementFromPoint`` hit test.

If Playwright or its Chromium is unavailable these tests SKIP, and the
skip says the rendering was NOT measured. A skip is the third outcome; it
is not a pass.
