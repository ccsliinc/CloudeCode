// Node test for the setup signal in macOS/tray-status.js and the menu-bar
// plumbing that reads it.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
//
// Two claims are being made by the menu bar once the setup wizard exists, and
// both are the kind that look right while being wrong:
//
//   1. "this instance needs setting up"  - which must reuse the existing
//      attention signal rather than invent a parallel one, because two
//      notions of "needs work" drift and the one nobody watches is the one
//      that rots.
//   2. "the server is at this address"   - which during the setup lockdown is
//      NOT the configured address. A menu that reads configuration and prints
//      it is printing an aspiration.
//
// The assertions that carry weight are the ones about the third outcome. A
// setup status of null means the server has not been asked; treating that as
// 'complete' would render an unmeasured instance as healthy, which is this
// project's signature failure mode.
//
// Run with: node tests/test_setup_signal.node.mjs
