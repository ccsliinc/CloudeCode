"""Which families need the user's rc sourced, and why the table was wrong.

THE DEFECT. ``AgentFamily.sources_zshrc`` was True for ``claude`` alone.
Every other family returned its configured static command RAW, straight
into ``tmux new-session ... <cmd>``. The tmux pane shell is
non-interactive and non-login, so it never reads ``~/.zshrc`` - which is
exactly the reasoning ``Settings.get_agent_command`` already spells out
at length for the claude family, and exactly why ``rc_prefixed`` exists.
A ``codex`` installed by nvm, asdf, mise, or any other version manager
that puts its shims on PATH from an rc file is therefore not on PATH, and
the pane dies with "command not found".

WHAT MAKES IT WORSE THAN A PLAIN OVERSIGHT, and the thing that argues the
table is wrong rather than the callers: the LAST-RESORT path already gets
this right. ``make_tool_last_resort`` wraps its script in ``rc_prefixed``
unconditionally. So the behaviour was inverted -

    codex_command = ""       -> last resort  -> rc-sourced   -> WORKS
    codex_command = "codex"  -> static path  -> raw          -> BROKEN

which means configuring NOTHING worked and leaving the SHIPPED DEFAULT in
place did not. ``AgentsConfig.codex_command`` defaults to ``"codex"``, so
the broken path is the one every install lands on.

``shell`` is deliberately NOT flipped. ``shell_command`` is ``$SHELL -i``,
an INTERACTIVE shell, which sources the user's rc itself by definition.
Wrapping it would source the rc twice and hard-code zsh as the launcher
for a family whose whole point is honouring ``$SHELL``.
