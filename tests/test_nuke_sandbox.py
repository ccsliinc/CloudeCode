"""End-to-end sandbox exercise of the REAL, unmodified ``nuke.sh``.

Why this file exists
--------------------
``nuke.sh`` is the uninstaller. For months it reported a complete reset
while leaving the state directory - ``cloude.db``, ``refresh_tokens.db``,
``migration_trail.jsonl`` - untouched on disk, because it targeted a
hardcoded ``~/Library/Application Support/Cloude Code`` (with a space)
while the app has always used ``CloudeCode`` (no space). Surviving refresh
tokens are a security defect, not untidiness.

Nobody caught it because nobody could run the script: three of its targets
were non-redirectable (a machine-wide ``pgrep -f "Cloude Code" | xargs kill
-9``, absolute ``/tmp`` literals, and ``launchctl`` against the real GUI
session), so any rehearsal on a developer machine would have damaged that
machine.

The bar this file is written to
-------------------------------
Run the REAL script, byte-for-byte unmodified, with every destructive
effect confined to a temp sandbox, and judge the result FROM THE DISK
against a manifest taken before the run - never from the exit code. A
destructive script's exit code says nothing about what it destroyed.

On the two shims below
----------------------
``PATH`` is prefixed with a single stub: ``pgrep``. It exists only so that
a run of a HISTORICAL copy of this script (which honours no override at
all) cannot reach real processes with ``kill -9``. The current script must
not need it, and ``test_nuke_does_not_rely_on_path_stubs`` asserts it was
never invoked - so it is measured scaffolding, not hidden scaffolding. A
rehearsal that quietly depends on shims is a test of the shims.

``lsof`` is deliberately NOT stubbed: the script's port probe is read-only,
and ``_run_nuke`` refuses to run at all unless the sandbox port is verified
free, so the real ``lsof`` returns nothing and no kill follows.
