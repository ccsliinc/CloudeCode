"""Folder-name display, collision disambiguation, and the cross-host merge.

THE SLUG IS NOT INVERTIBLE, which is the fact every test here is built
around. Measured on the live corpus 2026-09-01:

    slug ...Production-bhpp-new-server   -> real .../bhpp_new_server
    slug ...Development-3D-Work          -> real .../3D Work
    slug ...Production-dev-tools-scripts -> real .../tools/dev_tools/scripts

Splitting a slug on '-' yields 'server', 'Work' and 'scripts' - wrong
every time, and wrong in the direction that invents collisions between
projects that do not collide. So display names come from observed_cwd,
and these tests pin that rather than the convenient string operation.

Collisions measured across the 77 merged projects: 69 distinct final
segments, 3 colliding names covering 11 projects ('.claude' x4,
'outputs' x4, 'scripts' x3).
