"""Claude-session identity and fork lineage.

WHAT THESE TESTS ARE ACTUALLY DEFENDING. Two claims, and neither is about
SQL.

FIRST: that a fork produces a SECOND ROW pointing at the one it came from,
rather than overwriting the first. The difference matters because the
overwrite is invisible - the table still looks healthy, the session still
works, and the only thing lost is the ability to ever reopen the
conversation that was there before. So the assertions are on ROWS AND
PARENT IDS read back out of the database, never on a function having been
called.

SECOND: that a lineage row cannot be mistaken for a live tmux session by
any reader that predates it. That is asserted against the actual identity
queries - ``get_instance``, ``owned_instances``, ``list_sessions`` - not
against the intention.

The hook-side guarantee (an unreachable server must not break a session
start) lives in tests/test_claude_hooks_fail_open.py, because it is a
property of the installed shell command rather than of this module.
