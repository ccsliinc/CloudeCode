"""``kind='automated'`` leaves the LISTS, and nothing else changes.

THE OWNER'S RULE, VERBATIM: "lists should always just be mine. the rest
can be found in the archive explorer." So these tests assert three things
that are easy to conflate:

  1. the v25 migration adds ``sessions.kind``, stamps the rows this app
     made ITSELF, and leaves imported rows NULL for the backfill;
  2. an automated row is absent from both list routes by default and
     present with ``include_automated=true``;
  3. a row with kind NULL or 'unknown' is present EITHER WAY - not
     having looked is not evidence of automation, and that is the whole
     reason the vocabulary has three words.

THE NEGATIVE CONTROLS ARE LOAD-BEARING. A suite in which every row is
hidden would pass just as happily if the filter dropped everything, so
every exclusion assertion is paired with a row that must SURVIVE it. And
the archive explorer is asserted structurally: it reads the transcript
archive, never the ``sessions`` table, so nothing here can hide a
transcript from it.
