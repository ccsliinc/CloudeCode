"""The durable row id shown on a session box, and the exact-key read.

WHY AN ID ON SCREEN AT ALL. A fork tree is unreadable when every row is
labelled only by a name the user reuses and re-mints. ``sessions.id`` is
the thing ``parent_session_id`` actually points at, so it is the only
number that lets a human follow "this came from that" by eye.

WHY THE EXACT KEY. An id is read AS identity. A name-only lookup can
return a DEAD session's row for a live pane, because tmux names are
reusable and this app re-mints them - and the user would then trust that
number. So the read is keyed on the full (socket, name, epoch) triple,
and a row with no epoch answers None rather than falling back.
