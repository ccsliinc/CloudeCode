"""VACUUM INTO versus cp, against a database with live WAL content.

THE CLAIM UNDER TEST. A plain byte copy of a WAL-mode SQLite database
opens cleanly and is silently missing every commit still sitting in the
-wal sidecar. VACUUM INTO asks SQLite to serialise a consistent snapshot
and captures them.

A test that only asserted "VACUUM INTO produced a good copy" would pass
against an implementation that used cp, on any database whose WAL happened
to be empty. So this file does BOTH copies and asserts they DIFFER. If the
two agree, the fixture failed to leave anything in the WAL and the test is
measuring nothing - which is itself asserted, out loud, before the real
assertion runs.

HOW THE WAL IS LEFT DIRTY. A child process opens the database in WAL mode,
commits, and exits via ``os._exit(0)``. That skips every interpreter
shutdown hook, so sqlite3 never closes the connection and never runs its
automatic checkpoint. A normal ``sys.exit`` would checkpoint on the way
out and hand the parent a fully-merged main file, i.e. exactly the
situation in which cp looks correct. Same technique the shell-side
tests/test_upgrade_backup.sh case 6 uses, for the same reason.
