"""The local secret gate and the CI secret gate must not disagree.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. On 2026-08-31 a commit passed the local pre-commit
hook and would have failed CI. The hook ran scripts/scan_secrets.py; CI ran
gitleaks. Only one of them ran before the commit, so the local gate
green-lit work the remote gate rejected - which is worse than having no
local gate, because it produces a record of having checked.

These tests pin the three invariants that failure depended on:

  1. .gitleaks.toml actually LOADS. gitleaks 8.30.1 refuses a config that
     mixes the legacy [allowlist] table with the [[allowlists]] array, and
     that refusal is an exit 1 that looks exactly like "leaks found".
  2. The allowlist is scoped BY VALUE, never by path. A `paths` entry
     suppresses the whole FILE, so a path-scoped exemption for a test
     fixture would silently blind the scanner to a real credential pasted
     into that same file.
  3. The hook runs BOTH scanners, with the same config CI uses.

Nothing here contains credential material. The positive control builds its
sample at runtime from `secrets`, so this file has no high-entropy literal
of its own for either scanner to trip on.
