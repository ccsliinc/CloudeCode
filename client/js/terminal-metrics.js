/**
 * Terminal measurement guard.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Owns one question: "is it safe to measure the terminal right now, and is
 * the number we just measured plausible?" Extracted so terminal.js (2333
 * lines) and terminal-layout.js do not grow.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS.
 *
 * A wrong cell measurement does not look like an error. It looks like a
 * working terminal rendering garbage, and it propagates: FitAddon derives
 * cols/rows from the measured cell, sendResize ships those to tmux, and
 * tmux reflows the real pane to a grid that matches nothing the user can
 * see. The user reported exactly this on a real phone while the desktop
 * and the desktop mobile emulator both looked correct.
 *
 * The measurement can go wrong for reasons that never raise:
 *
 *   1. xterm.css has not applied. Until it does, the char-measure element
 *      is not laid out the way xterm assumes and the cell comes out wrong.
 *      This used to be a third-party CDN request, so any content blocker
 *      (Brave Shields, ublock, a corporate proxy) could drop it and the
 *      only symptom was a wonky render. The assets are vendored same-origin
 *      now; this check is the defense that does not depend on that.
 *   2. The font is not resolved yet, so the cell is measured against a
 *      fallback with different metrics.
 *   3. The container is display:none or zero-sized, so the proposal is 0.
 *
 * The guard's contract: a measurement that cannot be trusted is SKIPPED
 * and retried, never shipped. Degrading to the previous known-good grid is
 * always better than corrupting the pane with a bad one.
 *
 * Loaded BEFORE terminal-layout.js, which calls guardedFit().
