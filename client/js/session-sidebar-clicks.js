/**
 * Session sidebar CLICK ROUTING - every handler for a click that lands
 * inside the list, lifted out of client/js/session-sidebar.js.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE FILE. session-sidebar.js reached 556 lines this
 * round, over the project's 500-line budget, and the click handlers were
 * the largest coherent thing in it that is not lifecycle. The controller
 * keeps what it is actually about - open, close, poll, fetch, render -
 * and hands off what happens when the user clicks something.
 *
 * WHY FREE FUNCTIONS TAKING `ctrl` RATHER THAN A MIXIN OR A SUBCLASS.
 * Splitting a class across two files by assigning onto its prototype
 * makes the class definition an incomplete statement of what the class
 * is: you cannot read session-sidebar.js and know its full surface. A
 * plain function that takes the controller as its first argument is
 * honest about the dependency, is directly callable from a test with a
 * stub controller, and leaves the class in one file. The controller
 * keeps thin delegating methods so every existing caller and every
 * existing test keeps working unchanged.
 *
 * ORDER MATTERS INSIDE onRowClick and is the whole reason it is one
 * function rather than several listeners: each nested control has to
 * claim the click before the row-level switch handler sees it, or
 * clicking pin would also navigate. A second listener cannot express
 * "before".
 *
 * Must load AFTER session-sidebar-rows.js and BEFORE session-sidebar.js.
