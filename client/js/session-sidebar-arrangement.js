/**
 * Session sidebar ARRANGEMENT - the ordering algebra. How a list of
 * session rows is sorted into the user's arrangement, and the four
 * operations that change it: pin, move, place, and merge.
 *
 * Everything about WHAT IS REMEMBERED lives one file down, in
 * client/js/session-sidebar-store.js: the localStorage envelope, its
 * three load outcomes, and the pin membership. This file was 524 lines
 * with both jobs in it, over the project's 500-line budget, and they are
 * genuinely different jobs. The dependency runs one way - this reads and
 * writes through the store, the store knows nothing about ordering.
 *
 * THE PUBLIC SURFACE IS UNCHANGED. `window.SessionSidebarArrangement`
 * still carries every name it did before the split, including the ones
 * that now live in the store, because a refactor that makes every caller
 * change is not a refactor. Callers and tests use the same API.
 *
 * A REMEMBERED NAME WHOSE SESSION IS GONE KEEPS ITS SLOT. It is not an
 * error and it is not dropped: the entry stays in storage at the same
 * index, renders no row, and is counted out loud by `arrange()`. So a
 * conversation that comes back lands back where the user left it,
 * instead of at the bottom as if it were new.
 *
 * THE INCOMING ORDER IS ONLY A FALLBACK. `arrange()` receives the
 * sidebar's built-in sort (this tab, then live, then newest) and uses it
 * ONLY for names the user has never arranged. A user-defined position is
 * never silently overridden by it, which is the whole requirement.
 *
 * Pure functions over plain objects, so it is testable without a
 * browser.
 *
 * Must load AFTER session-sidebar-store.js and BEFORE session-sidebar.js.

     *   a hard refusal, on the reasoning that a move must never change a
     *   pin the user could not see themselves perform. The user has since

     *   row has no row above it to cross past, so it does nothing rather
     *   than pinning into an empty band - `p` is the gesture for
     *   "pin where you are", and overloading Alt+Up with it would make the
     *   top row's behaviour depend on invisible state.
     * Inputs: name (string), delta (number) - -1 up, +1 down.
     *   visibleNames (Array<string>) - current top-to-bottom visible order.
     * Output: object|null - {order (Array<string>), crossed (boolean),
     *   pinned (boolean) - the row's pin state AFTER the move}, or null
