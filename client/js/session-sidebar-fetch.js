/**
 * Session sidebar FETCH - acquiring the row list, and the verdict about
 * whether it could be acquired at all.
 *
 * Split out of client/js/session-sidebar.js so that file stays under the
 * project's 500-line ceiling once pinning, ordering and density land in
 * it, and along an honest seam: this module knows about endpoints and
 * merging, the controller knows about the panel.
 *
 * TWO ENDPOINTS, ONE LIST. `GET /sessions/attachable` returns every tmux
 * session that can be joined (detached, or started outside this app);
 * `GET /sessions/list` returns the ones with a live backend, which is
 * where `session_id`, the live activity status and the unread flag come
 * from. Same merge the home screen does, trimmed to what the sidebar
 * renders.
 *
 * THE TWO FAILURES ARE NOT THE SAME FAILURE, and this is the bug that was
 * here before:
 *   attachable rejects  -> we do not know what exists. That is a verdict
 *                          of UNAVAILABLE and the caller must render
 *                          CANNOT DETERMINE, never an empty list.
 *   list rejects        -> we know what exists, we just do not know which
 *                          of them this browser has a backend for. The
 *                          rows are still real and still switchable, so
 *                          this is `ok` with less decoration on each row.
 * Folding the second into the first would page the user over nothing;
 * folding the first into "ok" is the false green.
 *
 * Must load AFTER api.js and session-listing-state.js, and BEFORE
 * session-sidebar.js runs.
