/**
 * KILLING WHAT IS RUNNING, AND SAYING SO FIRST.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TODO item 22 part 2. Restarting a session whose pane is ALIVE kills the
 * process in it and starts a new one in the same pane
 * (`tmux respawn-pane -k`), keeping the tmux name, the row and therefore
 * project attribution, pinned theme, unread state, group filing and
 * sidebar position - nothing is re-carried because nothing moves.
 *
 * IT IS DESTRUCTIVE AND IRREVERSIBLE, so it lives in its own file. The
 * restart picker is a chooser; this is the part that destroys something,
 * and a reviewer should be able to read all of it in one place rather
 * than find it woven through a panel that mostly does not.
 *
 * TWO PIECES, AND THEY ARE THE TWO GATES THE CLIENT OWNS.
 *
 *   `armHtml()`         an UNCHECKED checkbox, always. It takes no
 *                       argument, so there is no field in the server's
 *                       response that could pre-arm it. That is what
 *                       makes "a prediction is never a permission"
 *                       structural here rather than a rule to remember:
 *                       `projected_kind` drives the badge, the sentence
 *                       and the warning, and enables nothing, because
 *                       what enables a live choice is a checkbox state.
 *
 *   `liveConfirmCopy()` the sentence the user reads before anything
 *                       dies, naming the bare-shell outcome when that is
 *                       what the rung says. Measured on the owner's box
 *                       2026-09-07: 15 of 19 live sessions had BOTH an
 *                       empty `#{pane_start_command}` and a NULL
 *                       `agent_type`; re-measured against the live tmux
 *                       socket the same day, 18 of 22 have an empty
 *                       start command, and the ladder gates on THAT
 *                       field alone. So most of this box comes back a
 *                       login shell, and a confirmation that did not say
 *                       so would be teaching the user to click through
 *                       it.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED IF THIS FILE DOES NOT LOAD. The picker asks for the arm
 * control through `window.SessionRestartLive` and renders nothing when it
 * is absent, so a missing module means a live session simply cannot be
 * restarted - never that it can be restarted without asking.
 *
 * Load AFTER session-status-ui.js; BEFORE session-restart-picker.js.

     *   THE BARE SHELL WARNING IS THE REASON THIS IS SAFE TO SHIP.
     *   Measured on the owner's box 2026-09-07, 15 of 19 live sessions
     *   have BOTH an empty `#{pane_start_command}` and a NULL
     *   `agent_type`, so 79 percent of them come back as a login shell
     *   rather than as an agent. A confirmation that did not say so
     *   would be teaching the user to click through it.
     *
     *   IT ALSO SAYS WHAT HAPPENS TO THE CONVERSATION, because a
     *   restart MEANS resume - the owner's definition, 2026-09-07 - and
     *   the one case where that is not true is the one a user must be
     *   told about before the pane dies. The sentence comes from
     *   `SessionRestartContinuity.line`, which treats anything it does
     *   not recognise as 'unknown'. If that module is missing the
     *   continuity line is omitted rather than guessed: no line at all
     *   is better than a reassurance nobody measured.
     *
     *   The busy line INFORMS and never refuses: `activity_state` is
     *   known to read "working" for about four minutes after a resume
     *   before it self-corrects, so blocking on it would refuse a
     *   restart the user can plainly see is needed.
     * Inputs:
     *   preview (object) - the RestartPreviewResponse body.
     *   agentType (string|null) - the picked wrapper, null for baseline.
     *   status (string|null) - the row's activity status.
     * Output: object - {title, message, details, primaryLabel}.
