/**
 * Status LED - the two-ring session indicator.
 *
 * WHY TWO RINGS AND NOT ONE DOT. The old `.status-dot` collapsed two
 * genuinely independent questions into one colour: WHAT is the chat doing
 * (is it working, is it blocked on me, is it dead) and WHETHER it wants my
 * attention (is there something unread here). One dot cannot answer both -
 * `finished_unread` had to exist as a whole extra state just to say "done,
 * and also unread", and there was no way at all to say "working, and also
 * unread". Two rings say both at once and need no combined state.
 *
 * So this module models the LED as TWO INDEPENDENT DIMENSIONS:
 *
 *   inner dot  - the chat's own status. One of INNER_STATES.
 *   outer ring - activity and attention. One of OUTER_STATES.
 *
 * BOTH ARE DRAWN ON ONE ELEMENT. The inner dot is the span's fill and
 * the outer ring is a box-shadow on that same span - there is no
 * pseudo-element and no second box. A box gets pixel-snapped
 * independently of its parent's box, so a halo drawn as its own box came
 * apart from the dot by a device pixel whenever the dot landed on a
 * fractional x/y; a box-shadow is painted from the element's own border
 * box and cannot. See the header of client/css/status-led.css.
 *
 * They are set separately (`data-inner` / `data-outer`) and every
 * combination renders. That is deliberate: it is what lets a gallery
 * enumerate the whole matrix, and it is why neither vocabulary contains a
 * value that means something about the other one.
 *
 * PURE BY CONTRACT. `ledHtml()` touches no DOM, reads no globals, and
 * returns a string. It must stay that way - a standalone gallery page
 * embeds `client/css/status-led.css` and calls it directly, with none of
 * this app around it. No `document`, no `window`, no fetch.
 *
 * Colour and motion live entirely in `client/css/status-led.css`, keyed
 * off the two data attributes. There are no colour values in this file.
 *
 * Loads BEFORE client/js/session-status-ui.js, which maps this app's
 * `activity_status` onto these two dimensions and renders through here.
