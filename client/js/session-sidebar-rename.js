/**
 * Session sidebar INLINE RENAME - "double click to inline edit session
 * name in sidebar."
 *
 * THE HARD PART IS NOT THE EDITOR, IT IS THE CLICK. A row's single click
 * already means "switch to this conversation", and a browser delivers the
 * first click of a double-click BEFORE it delivers the dblclick - so the
 * naive version navigates away from the row a moment before the user
 * finishes asking to edit it. The fix is a deferral, and the whole design
 * is about keeping that deferral as small as it can possibly be:
 *
 *   - it applies ONLY to a click that landed on the row's NAME. Anywhere
 *     else on the row - the dot, the badge, the padding - switches
 *     instantly, exactly as before.
 *   - it applies ONLY to a row whose `data-rename-state` is
 *     'renameable'. A row with nothing to edit has nothing to wait for.
 *   - it is DBLCLICK_MS, and the operation it delays is a network round
 *     trip plus a terminal attach.
 * So the cost is bounded to one target on one class of row, and it buys
 * the gesture the user asked for. Anything wider than that would be
 * paying for this feature on every click in the list.
 *
 * THREE RENAMEABILITY STATES, AND THE EDITOR RESPECTS ALL THREE. The
 * classifier is `SessionSidebarRows.renameState()`, shared with the row
 * markup so the state the row DRAWS and the state the editor GATES ON
 * cannot disagree. Only 'renameable' opens an editor. 'unavailable' and
 * 'unknown' say why, in the live region and in the row's own title, and
 * open nothing - because an edit box that accepts text and then fails is
 * worse than no edit box: it takes the user's input and throws it away.
 * 'unknown' in particular is not folded into 'unavailable'; we do not
 * know that the rename would fail, we know that we cannot tell, and those
 * are different sentences.
 *
 * A FAILED RENAME RESTORES THE OLD NAME. The row is never left showing a
 * value the server rejected. The optimistic path here is deliberately
 * NOT optimistic: nothing is written into the row until the PATCH
 * resolves, and a rejection puts the editor back with the text still in
 * it and the reason underneath, so the user can fix it rather than retype
 * it.
 *
 * KEYBOARD PARITY: F2 on a focused row opens the same editor through the
 * same gate. F2 rather than Enter because Enter already activates the row
 * (client/js/session-sidebar-reorder.js), and rather than a bare letter
 * because `p` is already spent on pinning.
 *
 * Must load AFTER session-sidebar-rows.js and BEFORE session-sidebar.js.
