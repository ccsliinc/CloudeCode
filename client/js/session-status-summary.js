/**
 * Session status summary - roll a set of sessions up into ONE LED.
 *
 * A group header (and the launchpad's top bar, which is the same question
 * asked of every session at once) has to answer "is there anything in
 * here I need to deal with" without the user opening the group. That is a
 * pure fold over the children's states, and it lives here rather than in
 * either caller so the sidebar and the launchpad cannot drift.
 *
 * THE PRIORITY IS THE PRODUCT DECISION, so it is written down once, as
 * data, in SUMMARY_PRIORITY:
 *
 *   permission > input > working > unread > done > idle > dead > unknown
 *
 * Read it as "what is the most interesting thing in this group".
 * `permission` is a session STOPPED on a yes/no; `input` is one that
 * wants the user's eyes (a Notification, or a startup prompt nobody has
 * answered) without being stopped. They were one `waiting` bucket until
 * the 2026-09-08 split; permission leads because it is the only state in
 * the list that is guaranteed to make no progress at all until a human
 * acts, and a group header that hoisted a chatty notification over a
 * parked one would point the user at the wrong session.
 *
 * Both outrank working because they are about the USER and will stay
 * that way until they act; working will resolve on its own. Unread
 * outranks done and idle for the same reason. `idle` (added 2026-09-09,
 * the gray read/at-rest dot - see status-led.js) sits below `done`
 * because `done` here means "unread", the louder of the two rest states,
 * and above `dead`: a group with one unread and ten idle still bubbles
 * unread, and a group of nothing but idle sessions reads idle rather than
 * falling all the way to unknown. Dead sits BELOW both deliberately: a
 * dead pane in a group of live ones is not the headline, and hoisting it
 * would make a group with one corpse and nine busy sessions read as dead.
 * Unknown is last because it is the absence of a measurement, and any
 * measured state is more informative than no measurement.
 *
 * Depends on client/js/status-led.js (for the vocabularies) and nothing
 * else. No DOM, no globals beyond that one.
