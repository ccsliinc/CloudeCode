/**
 * ThemeAudioStatus - turns a ThemeAudio.getStatus() snapshot into the one
 * sentence the music control shows the user.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Five separate causes have made this app silent, and
 * every one of them failed the same way: no error, no message, and a
 * control that painted itself as ON. The manifest audio block was stripped
 * by the API response model, the master and per-theme gains multiplied to
 * -45 LUFS, .m4a was served as an unrecognised mime type under nosniff, the
 * element volume zeroed the whole Web Audio graph, and a detached session
 * kept vetoing the master switch. In all five the user tapped "play music",
 * the row said "stop music", and nothing came out.
 *
 * A control that reports success while producing no sound is the defect,
 * not the symptom. So the rule here is: if the snapshot does not positively
 * show audio reaching the speaker, describe() returns a REASON, and the
 * caller is expected to show it. Silence with no explanation is never a
 * valid outcome of this function.
 *
 * The three-outcome shape applies: playing, a named not-playing reason, or
 * "cannot tell yet" while a track is still opening. The third is a distinct
 * value, not a quiet pass - `settling` says the answer is not in yet and the
 * caller should ask again shortly.
 *
 * Pure and side-effect free: it takes a snapshot object and returns a
 * verdict, so it is unit-testable without a DOM, an AudioContext or a
 * network. Copy is lowercase to match the rest of the UI.
 *
 * Exposed as window.ThemeAudioStatus. Loaded AFTER themeAudio.js.
