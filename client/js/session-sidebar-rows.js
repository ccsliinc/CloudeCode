/**
 * Session sidebar ROW MARKUP - the HTML for one conversation row, and
 * the repaint signature that decides whether a repaint is needed at all.
 *
 * Split out of client/js/session-sidebar.js for the project's 500-line
 * rule, and along the same seam the repo already uses for row internals:
 * client/js/session-row-actions.js owns the destructive control and
 * client/js/session-status-ui.js owns the status dot and the mark-unread
 * toggle. This module is the row that composes them, nothing else - it
 * holds no state and touches no DOM, it only returns strings.
 *
 * WHAT EACH DENSITY DRAWS (see client/js/session-sidebar-density.js for
 * the modes and where the preference lives):
 *   compact   grip, dot, name, pin, mark-unread, delete
 *   cozy      the above plus the tmux/external badge  (DEFAULT)
 *   detailed  the above, with the badge moved DOWN to a second line that
 *             also carries the session's age
 *
 * NO AGENT-FAMILY PILL, AT ANY DENSITY, SINCE THIS ROUND. "i dont think
 * we need the pills in the sidebar take out for now." The pill is still
 * drawn on the HOME screen by client/js/launchpad.js, which owns its own
 * builder; nothing here feeds that one, so removing this row's pill
 * cannot change what the home screen renders.
 *
 * REMOVING IT ALSO REMOVED A REAL DEFECT, which is worth recording
 * because the shape of it recurs. This module's builder put a literal
 * `~` in front of a guessed family, AND `.family-pill--guess::before` in
 * client/css/styles.css adds another one - so a guessed family rendered
 * as `~~claude` on screen while every DOM assertion about the label read
 * a single, correct `~claude`. The launcher's builder never added the
 * literal, so only this surface was wrong. A test that reads DOM text
 * cannot see a `::before`; only a rendered pixel or a computed style can,
 * which is why the pill assertions in scripts/verify_sidebar_sessions.py
 * were the ones that could have caught it.
 *
 * WHAT NOW FILLS DETAILED'S SECOND LINE: the tmux/external badge, moved
 * down off the first line, plus the age it already carried. The badge is
 * emitted exactly once per row at every density either way - line one at
 * cozy, line two at detailed, and not at all at compact, which is
 * unchanged. The second line is therefore still a line about where the
 * session came from and how old it is, which is what it always was.
 *
 * THE ROW HEIGHTS ARE DECLARED, NOT EMERGENT. Removing a glyph from a
 * row would otherwise shorten it by however tall that glyph happened to
 * be, so `client/css/session-sidebar-density.css` now pins a `min-height`
 * per density. The density contract is a number the stylesheet states,
 * not an accident of whichever controls currently ride the line.
 *
 * A RESTART CONTROL IS NOW EMITTED for a row whose status is `dead`.
 * SUPERSEDES the rule that used to stand here, which read: "NO RESTART
 * CONTROL IS EMITTED HERE, AT ANY DENSITY. Sidebar rows come from the
 * attachable probe, which carries an activity status and no `lifecycle`
 * at all, so this module cannot know that a session is stopped rather
 * than unknown - and restarting something whose state you could not
 * determine is how you end up with two of it."
 *
 * Both halves of that were checked before it was changed, and both have
 * stopped being true:
 *
 *   1. THE STATUS IS NOT ALWAYS A GUESS. `session-sidebar-fetch.js`
 *      `mergeLiveRow()` overwrites `status` with the server's
 *      `activity_status` for every session this app holds a backend for,
 *      and that value is `resolve_pane_status()`'s reading of tmux's own
 *      `#{pane_dead}`. So `dead` on such a row is a measurement. A row
 *      the probe alone produced still carries `unknown`, and
 *      `SessionRowActions.actionsFor` refuses to treat `unknown` as
 *      stopped - so the undetermined case is still withheld, which is
 *      what the original rule was protecting.
 *   2. "TWO OF IT" IS NOT A REACHABLE OUTCOME for this control. Restart
 *      creates nothing: it runs `tmux respawn-pane` against the pane that
 *      is already there (see src/core/session_respawn.py). It never
 *      passes `-k`, and tmux REFUSES respawn-pane on a live pane without
 *      it, so even clicking a stale `dead` row cannot disturb a session
 *      that came back to life, let alone duplicate one.
 *
 * The destructive control (close vs remove) is unchanged and still comes
 * from SessionRowActions.
 *
 * Must load AFTER session-status-ui.js, session-row-actions.js and
 * session-listing-state.js, and BEFORE session-sidebar.js runs.

     * Description: whether this row's session can be renamed, as THREE
     *   states rather than a boolean, plus the sentence that says why.
     *
     *   This mirrors LaunchpadController._renderRenamePencilHtml exactly,
     *   on the same two fields, because a session must not be renameable
     *   on one surface and not on the other. The two fields answer
     *   DIFFERENT questions and neither one alone is the answer:
     *   `session_id` is only populated by the /sessions/list merge, so it
     *   really means "is there a live backend for this right now", while
     *   `created_by_cloude` is about ORIGIN and is genuinely NULLABLE -
     *   the server fills it from an ownership map that can simply have no
     *   entry for a name.
     *
     *     'renameable'  a session id is known. The rename endpoint is
     *                   keyed on it, so the edit can actually be sent.
     *     'unavailable' no session id, but ownership IS known, so the
     *                   precondition can be stated precisely: open it
     *                   (ours) or adopt it (external).
     *     'unknown'     no session id AND ownership is null. CANNOT
     *                   DETERMINE. `== null` catches null and undefined
     *                   and nothing else, deliberately - `!r.x` would
     *                   fold the genuine unknown into "external" and
     *                   invent an answer nobody measured.
     *
     *   The state is stamped on the row as `data-rename-state`, which is
     *   what client/js/session-sidebar-rename.js gates the inline editor
     *   on. A row that cannot be renamed must not silently accept an edit
     *   that is going to fail.
     * Inputs: r (object) - one merged session row.
     * Output: object - {state (string), reason (string)}.
