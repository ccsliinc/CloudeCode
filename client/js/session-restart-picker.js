/**
 * RESTART, WITH A CHOICE OF WRAPPER - and an honest answer first.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * "when resuming/restarting a session can we pick a new wrapper"
 *
 * Moving a session onto another launch wrapper (claude-chrome, say) used
 * to mean hand-editing `sessions.agent_type` in cloude.db. This panel is
 * what replaces that.
 *
 * IT IS A WARNING BEFORE IT IS A PICKER, and that order matters. The
 * respawn ladder gates on tmux's `#{pane_start_command}`: when that field
 * is EMPTY the restart lands on the `shell` rung and hands back a LOGIN
 * SHELL instead of an agent, silently. A picker that let someone
 * confidently choose claude-chrome and then dropped them at a zsh prompt
 * would be worse than no picker at all. So this panel opens by asking
 * `GET /sessions/restart/preview` - a read-only route that spawns
 * nothing - and paints the PREDICTED outcome next to every choice,
 * including the one where nothing is picked.
 *
 * THE THREE ANSWERS ARE THREE ANSWERS. "will start the agent", "will
 * return a plain shell" and "cannot be determined" are rendered
 * differently and the last never renders as the first. A choice whose
 * predicted rung is not actionable cannot be confirmed at all - the
 * button disables and says why.
 *
 * IT IS ALSO THE CONFIRMATION. A restart destroys what is in the pane,
 * so it must be confirmed - but a second modal after this one would ask
 * the user to agree twice to a decision this panel already spelled out
 * in full. The explicit "restart" button here IS the confirmation, and
 * the sentence above it is a better one than a generic dialog could
 * write. It reuses `.modal-overlay` / `.modal-content` so it is the same
 * object on screen as every other dialog in the app.
 *
 * ACTIVITY STATUS INFORMS, IT NEVER REFUSES. `activity_state` is known to
 * read `working` for about four minutes after a resume before it
 * self-corrects, so a hard block on it would refuse a restart the user
 * can plainly see is needed. When the row says the session is busy this
 * panel says so, in words, above the button - and then lets the user
 * decide.
 *
 * A LIVE SESSION GETS AN ANSWER AND STILL GETS NO BUTTON. The server
 * reports two things about every choice: what it would COME BACK AS
 * (`projected_kind`, which ignores liveness) and whether a restart may
 * act on it right now (`actionable_now`, which does not). The first is
 * what the badge and the sentence say, because "this one would come back
 * a plain shell" is useful about a session that is still running and is
 * the only useful thing there is to say about one. The second, and only
 * the second, enables the radio. A PREDICTION IS NEVER A PERMISSION.
 *
 * REPLACING WHAT IS RUNNING IS A SECOND, DELIBERATE ACT. On a pane that
 * is ALIVE this panel now offers one, and it is deliberately awkward to
 * reach: an unchecked box at the top of the list arms the choices, and
 * the button then routes through the app's confirm modal, which names
 * what is about to be killed. Nothing arrives armed and nothing in the
 * server's payload can arm it - `armLive` starts false on every render
 * whatever the preview says, so a live restart is always at least two
 * user acts away.
 *
 * THAT IS WHERE THE PREDICTION/PERMISSION LINE IS DRAWN, and it is drawn
 * with a value the server never sends. `projected_kind` is what a live
 * session would come back AS and it drives the badge, the sentence and
 * the warning; it does NOT enable anything. What enables a live choice is
 * `armLive && isActionable(projected_kind)`, and `armLive` is a checkbox
 * state. So there is no field in the response a client could echo into a
 * permission, which is the failure the ladder's docstring warns about.
 *
 * IT IS NOT CLOSE-AND-RECREATE. The owner's two calls (2026-09-07) were
 * "same tmux should be fine" and "yes resume the same session", which
 * make this `respawn-pane -k` against the same session name: no new row
 * is minted, so project attribution, pinned theme, unread state, group
 * filing and sidebar position stay put because nothing moves.
 *
 * THE ROWS ARE NOT IN THIS FILE. session-restart-options.js owns the
 * option list, the badge vocabulary and the rule that lifts a
 * session-level sentence out of the per-option loop; this file owns the
 * panel, the promise and the arming gate. The split happened because
 * this file was 578 lines and past the project's 500-line rule, and
 * because "which rows exist" and "what the panel does with a choice" are
 * two jobs. The helpers that moved are re-exported here unchanged, so
 * `SessionRestartPicker.optionsHtml` is still the same one function.
 *
 * Load AFTER api.js, app.js and session-restart-options.js; BEFORE
 * session-sidebar-clicks.js.

     *   status (string|null) - the row's activity status, shown not acted on.

     *   cancelled OR the preview could not be fetched. `error` is set on
