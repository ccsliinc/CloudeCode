/**
 * Terminal scroll anchoring.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Owns the single question "after this write, should the viewport jump
 * back to the bottom?" and nothing else.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (the scrollback bug):
 *
 * The original code answered that question with a boolean
 * (`Terminal#autoScrollEnabled`) that was flipped to false by a
 * `.xterm-viewport` scroll listener behind a 100ms debounce, while
 * `Terminal#flush()` called `scrollToBottom()` on EVERY write for as
 * long as the flag was still true. While an agent is streaming output
 * (a spinner alone redraws several times a second) those two race, and
 * the write always wins:
 *
 *   1. finger drags up  -> scroll event -> 100ms debounce timer starts
 *   2. output arrives inside that 100ms -> flag still true -> yanked
 *      back to the bottom
 *   3. the yank is itself a scroll event, so the debounce restarts; when
 *      it finally runs the viewport IS at the bottom, so the flag is set
 *      back to true
 *
 * The user can never stay scrolled up. The desktop wheel path dodged it
 * by clearing the flag synchronously (its own comment called this
 * "bypass the 100ms scroll-listener debounce race"), which is why the
 * wheel half-worked and touch did not at all.
 *
 * THE FIX: stop tracking intent in a racing flag and measure the actual
 * buffer position BEFORE each write. xterm exposes it exactly:
 * `buffer.active.viewportY` is the top row on screen and
 * `buffer.active.baseY` is the top row when scrolled fully down, so
 * `viewportY >= baseY` IS "the user is at the bottom". Sampled before
 * `term.write()` it cannot race the write, because it describes where
 * the user had already put the viewport. A short gesture latch covers
 * the remaining case of momentum scrolling passing through the bottom
 * mid-drag.
 *
 * No timers decide anything here; the latch only suppresses.

     * wheel keeps working. That asymmetry IS the reported bug: scrollback
     * exists, desktop scrolls, the phone cannot.
     *
     * Native scrolling is not an available fallback either: the touch
     * lands on `canvas.xterm-link-layer`, which is a SIBLING of

     * `.xterm-viewport` scrollHeight 5184 vs clientHeight 592):
     *
     *   - Claude Code 2.1.199 does NOT enable mouse reporting. The pane
     *     byte stream sets only ?25, ?2004, ?1004 and ?2031, and the live
     *     client reports `activeProtocol` NONE. The previous fix assumed
     *     the opposite, so its whole "xterm declined the event" branch was
     *     unreachable in the case the user was reporting.
     *   - With reporting off, xterm's own touchmove handler DOES run. It
     *     scrolls `.xterm-viewport.scrollTop` and then calls
     *     preventDefault. The old bubble-phase guard read that cancel as
     *     "xterm scrolled the buffer" and stood down.
     *   - It had not. `.xterm-viewport` is inert in this app: setting
     *     scrollTop to 1000 left `buffer.active.viewportY` at 236, fired
     *     no scroll event, and left xterm's own `_lastScrollTop` at 4592.
     *     xterm's viewport-to-buffer sync never runs here, so anything
     *     routed through the DOM scroller moves pixels and no rows.
     *
     * Net: the drag was cancelled by xterm, skipped by our guard, and
     * moved nothing. That is the reported "does not scroll in the tui".
     *
     * The wheel path never had this problem because it already bypasses
     * the DOM and calls `term.scrollLines()` directly. This makes touch do
