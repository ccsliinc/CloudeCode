/**
 * Session sidebar REORDER - the interaction that puts a session where the
 * user wants it, and the pin toggle that decides which band it lives in.
 *
 * TWO INTERACTIONS, AND WHY BOTH.
 *
 * Keyboard is the PRIMARY one, not the accessibility afterthought.
 *   ArrowUp / ArrowDown      move FOCUS between rows (roving tabindex, so
 *                            the list is one tab stop, per the WAI-ARIA
 *                            practice for a vertical collection)
 *   Alt+ArrowUp / Alt+Arrow  MOVE the focused row within its band
 *   Home / End               first / last row
 *   p                        toggle the focused row's pin
 *   Enter / Space            switch to the focused session
 * The Alt modifier is doing real work: bare arrows have to stay as
 * navigation or the list stops being browsable, and Alt+Up/Down is what
 * this audience already presses to move a line in VS Code, so the gesture
 * arrives already learned. Every one of these is a REAL key event in the
 * tests, dispatched at the row, not a method call standing in for one.
 *
 * Pointer drag is the SECONDARY one, on an explicit grip handle rather
 * than the whole row, because the row's own click already means "switch
 * to this conversation" and a drag that starts anywhere on it would make
 * every mis-swipe a navigation. Built on Pointer Events, so mouse, touch
 * and pen are one code path - HTML5 drag-and-drop would have been less
 * code and silently dead on a phone.
 *
 * A MOVE ACROSS THE BOUNDARY NOW PINS OR UNPINS, AND THAT REVERSES THE
 * RULE THIS FILE USED TO STATE. It used to read "a move never changes a
 * pin", and both interactions refused to cross. The user has since asked
 * for the crossing ("not sure how hard to be able to drag the items in
 * and our of pinned group"), so the protection MOVES rather than
 * disappearing: the thing being prevented was an unpin the user could not
 * see themselves perform, not the unpin itself. So every crossing move is
 * ANNOUNCED in words in the live region, and the row's pin button changes
 * its pressed state in the same paint. The crossing arithmetic still
 * lives in exactly one place (client/js/session-sidebar-arrangement.js),
 * so the pointer and the keyboard cannot disagree about it.
 *
 * KEYBOARD PARITY IS NOT OPTIONAL HERE. A pointer-only pin/unpin would
 * make the pinned group unreachable without a mouse, so there are TWO
 * keyboard routes to it and both work: `p` toggles the focused row's pin
 * where it stands, and Alt+Arrow past a band edge crosses the boundary
 * exactly as a drag does. The LIST edges are still hard refusals - Alt+Up
 * on the very first row has nothing above it to cross past, and
 * overloading it with "pin into the empty band" would make the top row's
 * behaviour depend on state that is not on screen.
 *
 * WHICH BAND A DROP LANDS IN IS READ OFF THE GROUP UNDER THE POINTER, not
 * off the nearest row. That resolution lives in
 * client/js/session-sidebar-drop-target.js. Those differ in the one case that matters: an
 * EMPTY pinned group has no rows to be near, and inferring the band from
 * the nearest row would make it permanently undroppable - which is the
 * case the whole feature exists for. That is also why
 * client/js/session-sidebar-groups.js draws the empty pinned group while
 * and only while a drag is in flight: a drop target that appears after
 * you hit it cannot be hit.
 *
 * FOCUS SURVIVES THE REPAINT. Every move rewrites the list's innerHTML,
 * which destroys the focused element; without restoring focus onto the
 * moved row, holding Alt+ArrowUp moves a row exactly once and then goes
 * dead. The restore is the feature, not polish.
 *
 * Announcements go to the panel's live region so a screen reader hears
 * "moved to position 2 of 6" - a reorder whose only feedback is visual is
 * not operable without a mouse in any sense that matters.
 *
 * Must load AFTER session-sidebar.js and session-sidebar-arrangement.js.
