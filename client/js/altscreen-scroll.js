/**
 * Alternate-screen scrollback for Claude Code's `tui: fullscreen`.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Claude Code's `tui` setting picks the renderer. Under `default` it draws
 * on the MAIN screen, so the terminal keeps real scrollback and
 * terminal-scroll.js can move it with `term.scrollLines()`. Under
 * `fullscreen` - the flicker-free mode, and the one a new user is most
 * likely to land on - claude switches to the ALTERNATE screen (`?1049h`).
 * The alternate screen has no scrollback by construction: measured on a
 * live 2.1.199 session, `tmux display-message -p '#{history_size}'` is
 * exactly 0 and xterm's `buffer.active.baseY` never leaves 0. There is
 * nothing for a scroll gesture to move. Scrolling appears to "stop at the
 * welcome header", which reads as a broken app.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MEASURED (claude 2.1.199, 100x30 pane, 2026-08-17)
 *
 *   - claude enables mouse tracking (`?1000h ?1002h ?1003h ?1006h`) and
 *     then IGNORES the wheel: SGR button 64 does nothing at any row,
 *     repeated or after a motion event.
 *   - PageUp, arrows, shift-arrows and X10 wheel all do nothing in the
 *     normal state.
 *   - `ctrl+o` (0x0f) opens claude's own "detailed transcript" view. In
 *     that view UP scrolls one row and PageUp jumps a page. 50 UPs in a
 *     single write moved exactly 50 rows - no coalescing, perfectly
 *     linear. Roughly 180 PageUps reached the very top of a 240-message
 *     transcript, so there is no depth limit.
 *   - A draft typed into the prompt SURVIVES a ctrl+o round trip intact.
 *   - The transcript view renders its own footer,
 *     "Showing detailed transcript - ctrl+o to toggle - up/down scroll",
 *     which is both the state signature and the user's way out.
 *
 * THE HAZARD, AND HOW IT IS CONTAINED
 *
 * This module synthesises keystrokes into a live session that may hold
 * the user's real work. `ctrl+o` means something else - sometimes
 * destructive - in a shell, in nano, and in several REPLs, and all of
 * those can also own the alternate screen. So the alternate screen alone
 * is NEVER sufficient authority to inject. Every send is gated on a
 * POSITIVE identification of claude's own chrome, read out of the xterm
 * buffer at the moment of the gesture, plus a typing quiet period. When
 * the read is anything other than a confident claude state the answer is
 * to do nothing at all. See detectState().

     *
     *   'main'       - not the alternate screen. Real scrollback exists;
     *                  the caller must use term.scrollLines() and this
     *                  module must not touch anything.
     *   'transcript' - claude's detailed-transcript view is open. Proven
     *                  by its own footer text, which no other program
     *                  prints, and which claude only draws in that view.
     *                  Arrow keys here are the documented scroll keys.
     *   'live'       - claude's normal view. Proven by its prompt frame:
     *                  a rule row, a caret row, another rule row, in three
     *                  consecutive visible rows. `less`, `htop`, `top` and
     *                  `vim` were each run on the alternate screen and
     *                  none of them produces that shape (verified
     *                  2026-08-17); a shell prompt using U+276F lives on
     *                  the MAIN screen and is excluded by the gate above.
     *   'unknown'    - the alternate screen is owned by something we
     *                  cannot identify, OR it is claude showing a dialog
     *                  in place of its prompt. Both mean the same thing:
     *                  we have no authority to synthesise a keystroke.
     *
     * The third outcome is a real answer, not a flavour of the other two.
     * Callers must treat 'unknown' as "inject nothing", never as "probably
     * fine".
