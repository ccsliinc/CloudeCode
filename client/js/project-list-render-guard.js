/**
 * WHEN A REPAINT IS WORTH DOING, AND WHEN IT IS PURE DESTRUCTION.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The launchpad's 5s running-sessions poller ends in two unconditional
 * `innerHTML =` writes: `renderRunningSessions()` and
 * `renderProjectList()`. The running-sessions one has carried a
 * signature diff since the pulse-glow flicker was traced to it. The
 * project list never had one, so it tore down and rebuilt its entire
 * subtree every five seconds forever, whether anything had changed or
 * not, and whether or not the launchpad was even the screen on display.
 *
 * Measured on a 9-project / 6-session fixture before this module
 * existed: 10 poller ticks against UNCHANGED data produced 10 rebuilds
 * of `#project-list`, 360 `addEventListener` registrations and 40
 * fetches - and the identical 10 / 360 / 40 with the launchpad hidden
 * behind the terminal screen. After: 0 / 0 / 0 in both cases. The live
 * screen is bigger than the fixture (about 794 nodes and 45 listeners
 * per rebuild), so the saving there is proportionally larger.
 *
 * THE SIGNATURE IS THE MARKUP ITSELF, and that is a deliberate
 * departure from `_lastRunningSig`, which fingerprints a hand-listed
 * set of row fields. A hand-listed fingerprint has one failure mode
 * that is invisible until a user reports it: a field the template
 * renders but the signature does not name stays on screen stale
 * FOREVER, because the guard keeps answering "nothing changed" about a
 * thing that changed. This project has already paid for that twice -
 * see the `wrapper:` line in `renderRunningSessions`' signature and
 * `tests/test_session_theme_tint.node.mjs`. Comparing the built HTML
 * against the last painted HTML cannot drift out of sync with the
 * template, because it IS the template's output. Building the string is
 * microseconds; parsing it into ~800 nodes and re-binding ~45 listeners
 * is what actually costs.
 *
 * SKIPPING A PAINT IS NOT REMEMBERING IT. A skip on any ground other
 * than "identical" leaves the stored signature alone, so the very next
 * tick paints. That is what makes deferral safe: there is no queue, no
 * timer and no flag to leak - the work simply happens on the next pass
 * once the reason to defer has gone.
 *
 * THREE OUTCOMES ON VISIBILITY, and the third one paints. `visible` and
 * `hidden` are read off `#launchpad-screen`'s `active` class, which is
 * what `App.showLaunchpad()` / `App.hideAllScreens()` actually toggle.
 * When neither the element nor `App.currentScreen` can be read the
 * answer is `cannot_determine`, and that POLLS AND PAINTS. Not having
 * been able to look is not evidence the screen is hidden, and a guard
 * that treated it as such would silently freeze the launchpad on any
 * page whose markup it did not recognise.
 *
 * BUSY IS MEASURED IN THE CONTAINER WE ARE ABOUT TO WIPE. An open row
 * overflow menu (`SessionRowMenu.isOpen()` - its own predicate, reused
 * rather than re-derived) and a live inline rename input both mean a
 * user is mid-interaction with something a repaint would delete under
 * their hands. The focus test is scoped with `container.contains()` on
 * purpose: a focused input anywhere else on the page is none of this
 * guard's business, and a page-wide focus test would let one stray
 * focused field freeze the list indefinitely.
 *
 * Named for its first consumer, but `isBusy` is shared: launchpad.js
 * consults it from `renderRunningSessions()` too, because the inline
 * rename input lives in THAT list and it is that list which would
 * clobber it. Load BEFORE launchpad.js.
