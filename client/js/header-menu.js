/**
 * Header overflow menu.
 *
 * AN OVERFLOW, NOT A RESPONSIVE FOLD ANY MORE. This used to move the
 * whole six-icon cluster into a dropdown below 768px and lay it back out
 * inline above it. It now holds TWO controls at EVERY width - logout and
 * settings - because those are the rarely-used ones, and a control that
 * is rare on a phone is rare on a desktop too. A layout
 * that changes what is reachable with the window width teaches two
 * different apps.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* IN HERE:
 *   - `#configEditorBtn` (file editor). Used constantly, so it stays
 *     inline and one tap away at every width. This is the whole point of
 *     the split; do not "tidy" it into the menu.
 *   - `#statusText`. A live state light, not an action. Hiding it behind
 *     a tap would mean connection state is only visible to someone who
 *     went looking for it. It is no longer in the header row at all -
 *     it lives in the home screen's bottom bar or, on the terminal
 *     screen, on the FAB rail (see App._placeStatusLight). This module
 *     never sees it, and must not gain a rule that does.
 *   - `#session-sidebar-toggle`, top-LEFT and the one-handed reach
 *     target on a phone. This module never touches it.
 *   - Home and detach, which no longer exist as header buttons: clicking
 *     the title goes home, and detach moved to the session editor FAB.
 *
 * SCOPE BOUNDARY: this menu is APP-scoped and mounts on every screen
 * including the launchpad, where no session exists. Anything
 * session-scoped belongs to the session editor FAB, which hides itself
 * when nothing is attached.
 *
 * THERE IS NO AUDIO CONTROL HERE, AND ADDING ONE WOULD BE A REGRESSION.
 * An "app sound (all sessions)" toggle used to live in this menu. Being
 * app-scoped, persisted and defaulted OFF, it sat in front of the session
 * editor's "play music" row and silently vetoed it, which is why the app
 * produced no sound through five separate fixes. Audio is session-only
 * now, so the only music control is the session-scoped one in the FAB.
 *
 * WHY MOVE THE NODES INSTEAD OF RENDERING A SECOND COPY: every one of
 * these controls is addressed by id from elsewhere in the app
 * (`document.getElementById('settingsBtn')`, `.classList.remove('hidden')`
 * on screen change, click listeners wired once in app.js). A cloned
 * mirror menu would duplicate ids, strip listeners, and drift out of
 * sync with the show/hide gating the moment anything changed.
 * Re-parenting keeps one node per control, so every existing id lookup,
 * listener and `.hidden` toggle keeps working untouched.
 *
 * Depends on window.DismissGuard (client/js/dismiss-guard.js) for
 * outside-click dismissal - deliberately click-based, never focusout, so
 * the dropdown cannot reintroduce the "focus a child input and the menu
 * vanishes" bug that DismissGuard exists to kill.

 * gives: the inline slots are for controls used constantly, and a
 * message browser is not one of them. Before it existed there was no way
 * into the archive from anywhere in the app - measured, the only control
 * in the whole DOM matching /archive/ was the archive screen's own Back
