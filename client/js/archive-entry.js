/**
 * The way INTO the archive from the rest of the app.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Before it, there was no way in at all. Measured
 * on the running app at 9d190df:
 *
 *   grep -rn 'archive' client/js/launchpad.js client/js/header-menu.js
 *       -> no matches
 *   /archive/i.test(document.body.innerText) on the launchpad
 *       -> false
 *   the only control in the entire DOM matching /archive/
 *       -> the archive screen's own Back button
 *
 * So the message browser shipped complete and reachable only by typing
 * the URL. A screen with no entry point is a screen nobody uses, and
 * "the feature is broken" and "the feature is unreachable" look
 * identical from outside.
 *
 * ONE IMPLEMENTATION, TWO ENTRY POINTS. The launchpad row and the header
 * overflow item both call `open()` here rather than each doing their own
 * pushState-and-show. Two copies of a navigation is two copies that can
 * drift - one of them gains a guard, or a route parameter, or a
 * different history mode, and from then on the two doors lead to subtly
 * different places with nothing to say so.
 *
 * WHY pushState AND THEN showArchive, IN THAT ORDER. `App.showArchive()`
 * activates the screen but does not write the address bar - the router
 * owns the inbound half and archive-screen.js owns the outbound half for
 * routes WITHIN the archive. The bare `/archive` entry belongs to
 * neither, so it is written here, BEFORE the screen is shown, because
 * `Router.resetToLauncher()` explicitly refuses to clobber the URL once
 * the path already reads `/archive` (see its guard). Doing it the other
 * way round races that guard.
 *
 * THE ARCHIVE IS OFF BY DEFAULT, AND THIS MODULE IS WHERE THE CLIENT
 * FINDS THAT OUT. `ensure()` measures it once per page load against
 * `GET /api/v1/features`, which the server mounts whether the feature is
 * on or off precisely so that "off" and "on but broken" are different
 * answers rather than the same silence. Both entry points - the launchpad
 * row and the header overflow item - render HIDDEN and reveal themselves
 * only on `enabled`. `unknown` (a failed probe, an API client that never
 * loaded, a server that answered something this build does not
 * understand) leaves them hidden: a door drawn on a guess leads onto a
 * 302 and a wall of 404s, and the two failure directions are not
 * symmetric.
 *
 * A FAILED pushState IS NOT A FAILED NAVIGATION. The History API throws
 * in a sandboxed iframe; router.js already swallows exactly this and
 * carries on, and so does this. The screen still opens; only the address
 * bar is wrong, which is a strictly smaller problem than not opening.
