/**
 * Session sidebar GROUP STORE - the user's named groups, read from and
 * written to the database, and the band algebra that turns them plus the
 * pin set into the list's top-to-bottom sections.
 *
 * THE DATABASE IS THE ONLY SOURCE. There is no localStorage mirror of a
 * group, deliberately. `client/js/session-sidebar-store.js` keeps the
 * pin set and the manual order because those are per-device VIEW state;
 * a group is a FACT about the conversation, and the moment it exists in
 * two places the sidebar has to decide which of two disagreeing lists to
 * draw. That is the defect that moved projects to DB-only, and it would
 * land in this same panel.
 *
 * THREE OUTCOMES, AND THE THIRD ONE CHANGES WHAT IS DRAWN:
 *
 *   'unknown'      no read has completed yet. Draw the list exactly as
 *                  it was drawn before groups existed.
 *   'ok'           the groups are known. An empty list genuinely means
 *                  the user has made none.
 *   'unavailable'  CANNOT DETERMINE. The datastore is absent, predates
 *                  v8, or would not open.
 *
 * 'unavailable' AND 'ok WITH NO GROUPS' RENDER IDENTICALLY - ungrouped -
 * BUT THEY ARE NOT THE SAME STATE, and the difference is visible: the
 * panel says so in words (see `noticeText`), and every group-creating
 * control is disabled rather than silently failing. Drawing "you have no
 * groups" over a table we could not read would be a verdict nobody
 * measured, and letting the user make a group that cannot be saved is
 * worse than telling them why they cannot.
 *
 * BANDS. The list's sections, top to bottom, are:
 *
 *   PINNED        every pinned row, whatever group it belongs to
 *   <group>...    each user group, in its stored position order
 *   OTHER         everything else
 *
 * PINNED IS NOT A GROUP - see the long argument in
 * src/core/session_group_store.py. The short form: a group is a bucket
 * (exactly one holds you) and a pin is a flag (orthogonal to which
 * bucket you are in), so folding them together would make pinning a
 * conversation EJECT it from the group the user filed it in. Instead a
 * pinned row renders in PINNED and carries a chip naming its group, so
 * the filing stays visible while the pin decides where it sits. Unpin it
 * and it drops back into its group.
 *
 * A DROP TARGET IS THEREFORE TWO FACTS, not one, and `bandIntent()` is
 * the single place that maps a band to them:
 *
 *   pinned      -> pin it, LEAVE its group alone
 *   a group     -> file it there, and unpin it
 *   other       -> ungroup it, and unpin it
 *
 * The unpin on the last two is not a policy choice, it is arithmetic: a
 * row that stayed pinned would be re-partitioned straight back into
 * PINNED by `arrange()` on the very next paint, so the drop would
 * visibly snap back. This is the same reasoning that already makes a
 * cross-boundary drag pin or unpin.
 *
 * Must load BEFORE session-sidebar-arrangement.js.
