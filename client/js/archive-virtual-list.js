/**
 * Variable-height windowing for the archive reader.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SCROLL HANDLER AND NOT AN IntersectionObserver PER ROW.
 * The largest transcript in this corpus is 30,805 lines (id 5767,
 * measured 2026-08-31). One observer per row is 30,805 live compositor
 * registrations, each with its own root-margin geometry, and creating
 * them all blocks the main thread on the exact transcript the feature
 * exists to open. The rejection is structural, not a preference. This
 * engine is a binary search over a Float64Array plus a forward walk:
 * O(log N) to find the window and O(visible) to fill it, and neither
 * term depends on N.
 *
 * THE SCROLLBAR IS HONEST. Total height starts as the sum of estimates
 * derived from `body_chars` on the spine and converges as real rows are
 * measured. It is never rounded to a pretty number and no page count is
 * published, because a page count over variable-height rows is a number
 * nobody computed.
 *
 * THE ANTI-JUMP RULE IS THE HARD PART. Every estimate is wrong. When a
 * row ABOVE the viewport turns out to be taller or shorter than its
 * estimate, every row below it moves, and the content under the reader's
 * eyes leaps. On a 30,805-line document that loses their place
 * permanently. So `applyMeasurements()` returns the exact pixel delta
 * contributed by rows strictly above the first visible row, and the
 * caller MUST add it to scrollTop in the SAME frame, before paint.
 * Deferring it to a later frame is worse than not compensating at all,
 * because a one-frame leap reads as a bug rather than as scrolling.
 *
 * NO DOM IN THIS FILE. It is pure geometry over typed arrays, so the
 * whole windowing algorithm is testable under plain node with no
 * harness, and no rendering path can reach around it.
 *
 * Depends on nothing. Exports window.ArchiveVirtualList.
