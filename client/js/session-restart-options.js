/**
 * THE RESTART PICKER'S OPTION LIST, and the one fact that is not a choice.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Split out of session-restart-picker.js, which was 578 lines and past
 * this project's 500-line rule before anything below was added. The
 * picker still owns the panel, the promise and the arming gate; this file
 * owns the rows, and it is the whole of what is drawn inside
 * `.restart-picker__options`.
 *
 * A PROPERTY OF THE SESSION IS NOT A PROPERTY OF THE CHOICE, and getting
 * that wrong is what this file was extracted to fix. The owner opened
 * restart on a session whose transcript is gone and read the SAME
 * sentence five times, once under every wrapper:
 *
 *   no transcript for claude session db81f6bf-... exists under
 *   /Users/jsugamele/.claude/projects, so it cannot be resumed
 *
 * Whether a conversation is on disk cannot vary with which wrapper is
 * picked to reopen it, so printing it per option told the user nothing
 * about any of the options and buried the four words that DID differ.
 * `sharedDetail()` detects that case and `optionsHtml()` drops the line
 * from every row, leaving one statement above the list.
 *
 * IT IS DETECTED, NOT ASSUMED, and that is deliberate rather than
 * defensive. Continuity genuinely CAN differ between these rows: the
 * replay rung re-runs the command tmux recorded and resumes whatever
 * uuid THAT string carries, while the agent rung resumes the uuid on the
 * session's row. They are frequently different conversations and either
 * may be absent on its own, which is exactly why the server measures
 * presence into a `presence_by_uuid` map rather than reaching a single
 * verdict (src/core/session_manager.py, src/core/session_restart_preview.py).
 * So the hoist fires only when every row's sentence is byte-identical,
 * which is the proof that it is a session-level fact. The moment two rows
 * disagree, both sentences stay on their own rows where they mean
 * something.
 *
 * Load AFTER session-sidebar-rows.js; BEFORE session-restart-picker.js.

    /**
     * Description: the durable key for a tmux name, or null when naming
     *   one would be a guess.
     *
     *   A NAME IS NOT AN IDENTITY. The recreate endpoints take a
     *   `session_uuid` precisely because a tmux name is reusable and this
     *   app re-mints them, so several records can carry one name across
     *   time. The sidebar addresses its rows by name and holds no uuid,
     *   so something has to bridge the two - and the bridge REFUSES
     *   rather than picks. Exactly one record carrying the name is an
     *   unambiguous answer; two is a question this function cannot
     *   settle, and answering it with "the newest" is the recency guess
     *   the server-side guard exists to keep out of new code.
     *
     *   A REFUSAL COSTS THE USER THE OFFER, NOT THEIR SESSION. With no
     *   uuid the panel shows the restart preview's honest
     *   `cannot_determine`, which is exactly what it showed before this
     *   feature existed.
     * Inputs: records (Array<object>|null) - rows from
     *   `GET /sessions/records`. tmuxName (string).
     * Output: string|null - the `session_uuid`, or null.
     * Example: recreateTarget([{tmux_name: 'a', session_uuid: 'u'}], 'a')
     *   // 'u'
