/**
 * The MERGED project view: one flat, fuzzily-filterable list of projects
 * with the machine demoted to a badge and a filter.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE FILE FROM archive-nav.js. That file owns the
 * rail's STATE and the host -> corpus -> project drill-down, and was at
 * 329 lines against this repo's 500-line cap. Everything here is about
 * ONE LEVEL - the merged list, its host filter, and the unattributed
 * nodes that sit beside it - so the seam is a real one and not a
 * line-count dodge.
 *
 * THE MACHINE MOVED, IT DID NOT GO AWAY. The old rail made the host a
 * LEVEL you clicked through. The owner is consolidating onto one
 * machine, at which point "which box was this born on" stops being a
 * question worth two clicks and becomes a detail worth a badge. So:
 *
 *   - every node carries its `hosts` as badges, and a node on two
 *     machines says so on its face;
 *   - `setHostFilter(hostId)` narrows the list to projects with a member
 *     on that machine, and the by-machine drill-down is still there
 *     behind the view toggle.
 *
 * Nothing is discarded. Measured 2026-09-01: 80 project rows merge to 77
 * nodes and exactly 3 projects exist on both machines, with byte-
 * identical observed_cwd on each - which is what makes the merge a
 * statement about identity rather than a relabel.
 *
 * THE UNATTRIBUTED NODES ARE HIDDEN ON A KNOWN ZERO AND ONLY THEN. The
 * rule lives in ArchiveNavRow.shouldShowUnattributed and the reason it
 * gave is written onto the node, so a hidden node is a decision someone
 * can inspect rather than an absence they have to trust. A corpus whose
 * count the server could not measure keeps its node.
 *
 * Exports window.ArchiveNavMerged.
