/**
 * Deep-link router (Item 9).
 *
 * Reads the URL on page load. When the path matches `/session/<project>`,
 * validates the slug against a strict client-side regex, and - once the
 * user has authenticated - hands the project name to the launchpad so
 * it can auto-open that session.
 *
 * Security posture:
 * - The SERVER route `/session/{project}` intentionally serves the SPA
 *   shell for ANY single-path-segment value. The meaningful validation
 *   happens here, in the browser, so we can show a visible error rather
 *   than a 404 when a user pastes a malformed link.
 * - We REJECT invalid names (show a banner + clear the URL), we do NOT
 *   silently strip - silent stripping turns a bad link into a working
 *   one pointing at an unintended project, which is worse than failing
 *   loudly.
 * - Allowed chars are deliberately narrow: `[A-Za-z0-9_\- ]`. This
 *   excludes `.`, `/`, `..`, `?`, `#`, and all control bytes. The
 *   server-side slugify (src/core/tmux_backend._slugify) maps `.` to
 *   `_` before the slug becomes a tmux session name, so a deep link
 *   produced by a push notification will already be in our allowed set.
 *
 * Flow:
 * 1. `initRouter()` is called on page load from index.html.
 * 2. If the current path is `/session/<raw>`, we URL-decode + validate.
 * 3. Invalid → show banner, `history.replaceState` back to `/`, done.
 * 4. Valid → stash the target name on `window.DeepLinkTarget`.
 * 5. On the `authenticated` event (fired by auth.js after login), we
 *    hand the stashed name to `window.Launchpad.openProjectByName()`
 *    if the method exists; otherwise we fall back to firing a custom
 *    `deep-link-project` event that launchpad can listen for.
 * 6. We also listen for `popstate` so browser back/forward re-triggers
 *    the same flow.
