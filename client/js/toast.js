/**
 * Toast Manager
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Renders toast notifications surfaced by the server over the WebSocket
 * (toast.new / toast.ack frames) AND backfilled via the REST endpoint
 * on session attach. Per-toast accent color is sourced from the server's
 * project-theme resolution and applied as `style="--toast-accent: <hex>"`
 * on the toast element - the CSS picks it up as a left border.
 *
 * WHAT THESE TOASTS ARE, because it determines everything below: they are
 * NOT ephemeral snackbars. There is no dwell timer anywhere in this file
 * and there deliberately still is not one. A toast is a server-backed
 * record that survives a reload, is re-delivered by the attach backfill,
 * and disappears only when ACKED. An auto-dismiss would have to either
 * auto-ack (silently destroying a PermissionRequest the user never saw)
 * or hide-without-acking (a ghost that returns on the next attach). Both
 * are worse than a tall stack. Hover-to-pause is likewise moot with no
 * timer to pause.
 *
 * THE PILE-UP, and where it comes from. Every emitter is a Claude Code
 * hook (src/core/claude_hooks.py TOAST_EVENTS) and exactly one of the
 * three is chatty: `Stop` fires once per assistant turn, always with the
 * literal title "Your turn". A ten-turn session is ten identical cards
 * nobody acked. `Notification` is occasional; `PermissionRequest` is rare
 * and is the one the user actually has to act on.
 *
 * SO THE STACKING POLICY IS THREE RULES, each declared rather than
 * inferred:
 *
 *   1. COALESCE repeats into one card with a count. The pre-existing
 *      dedupe is by `id` only - that covers the backfill/WS race and
 *      nothing else. Ten `Stop` events are ten distinct ids saying one
 *      thing. `COALESCE_KEY` below declares, per kind, what "the same
 *      thing" means, and PermissionRequest is deliberately excluded.
 *   2. CAP the number of visible cards and put the rest behind ONE
 *      overflow row that states how many it is holding and the worst
 *      severity in there. Nothing is dropped and nothing is auto-acked:
 *      an overflowed toast is still unacked on the server, still in
 *      `_byId`, still counted on screen, and one click from view.
 *   3. TIER by severity. High-severity groups sort to the top AND are
 *      exempt from the cap entirely - the cap exists to suppress noise,
 *      and a blocking permission prompt is not noise. So a
 *      PermissionRequest can never be the thing hidden behind "+7 more".
 *
 * NEVER SILENTLY LOSE SOMETHING THE USER NEEDED. Every suppression path
 * above stays reachable: the cap holds a live, counted, one-click set and
 * exempts high severity; a coalesced card carries every member id and
 * acks all of them on dismiss, so no member is orphaned server-side; and
 * nothing in this file expires on a timer.
 *
 * Dismiss flow:
 *   - User clicks x  -> fade-out animation -> POST to
 *     /api/v1/toasts/<id>/ack for EVERY member of the group -> server
 *     broadcasts toast.ack -> other tabs dismiss in lockstep (with
 *     syncToServer=false to skip the round-trip).
 *   - Server-driven ack (from another browser) -> dismiss(id, {syncToServer:
 *     false}) - no echo back to the server.
 *
 * No localStorage cross-tab sync; the WS broadcast is the source of truth
 * for ack propagation.
