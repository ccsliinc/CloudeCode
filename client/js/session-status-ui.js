/**
 * Session Status UI - shared status-dot rendering for the launchpad's
 * "Running Sessions" list and the in-terminal session sidebar.
 *
 * Single source of truth so the two call sites never drift on colors,
 * labels, or the accessibility wiring (title + aria-label, never
 * color-only - a user who can't distinguish the dot colors still needs
 * to know what state a session is in).
 *
 * feat/hook-driven-status: states mirror the backend's UNIFIED vocabulary
 * (src/core/session_status.py's ALL_ACTIVITY_STATUSES), driven by Claude
 * Code's own lifecycle hooks where available and gracefully falling back
 * to tmux-only classification otherwise. Listed in the exact display
 * priority the states are meant to be noticed in:
 *   dead             - the pane's process exited; tmux is only holding
 *                       the corpse open. Loudest treatment on purpose
 *                       (see CLAUDE.md hazard: a dead pane that "looked"
 *                       fine).
 *   question         - Claude is BLOCKED on you: a PermissionRequest
 *                       hook fired and nothing has resolved it yet. It
 *                       will not proceed until you answer.
 *   notice           - Claude WANTS you: a Notification hook fired and
 *                       nothing has resolved it yet. Not blocked. Split
 *                       out of `question` on 2026-09-08 - see
 *                       docs/session-status.md for why one state could
 *                       not honestly carry both.
 *   working_subagent - the agent is actively working INSIDE a spawned
 *                       subagent (SubagentStart/Stop heartbeat).
 *   working          - the agent is actively doing tool work at the top
 *                       level (PreToolUse/PostToolUse heartbeat), or (no
 *                       hook signal at all) tmux reports a non-shell
 *                       foreground process - the old "running".
 *   finished_unread  - a Stop hook landed and nobody has looked since, OR
 *                       the user manually pinned this session unread for
 *                       followup. THE LED IS WHAT SAYS SO: since the
 *                       owner's 2026-09-09 ruling this state paints a
 *                       still green ring around a recessed centre. The
 *                       manual toggle that SETS it is a separate thing
 *                       and still ships, behind
 *                       `ui.show_mark_unread_control`.
 *   idle             - alive, nothing pending, already seen.
 *   unknown          - status could not be determined (non-tmux backend,
 *                       tmux query failed, or hooks not installed AND
 *                       tmux itself can't classify the pane). Never
 *                       guessed.
 *
 * Must load AFTER no other module (no dependencies) and BEFORE
 * launchpad.js / session-sidebar.js, both of which call into it.
