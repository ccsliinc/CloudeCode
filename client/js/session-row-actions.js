/**
 * Session Row Actions - the single source of truth for the destructive
 * control a session row offers, in EVERY place a session row is drawn
 * (the launcher's "running sessions" list in client/js/launchpad.js and
 * the in-terminal conversation sidebar in client/js/session-sidebar.js).
 *
 * The two actions, and the promise each one makes to the user:
 *
 *   X (close)      kills the tmux session. The Claude process stops, and
 *                  that part is irreversible. The transcript JSONL is NOT
 *                  touched and stays under ~/.claude/projects, so the
 *                  conversation can be resumed later by Claude Code
 *                  itself.
 *   trash (remove) forgets the entry in CloudeCode. Only offered for a
 *                  row whose process has ALREADY exited, so there is
 *                  nothing running left to terminate; clearing the
 *                  leftover tmux husk is what makes the entry go away.
 *
 * NEITHER action is disk-free. Both can route to DELETE /sessions, which
 * removes the session's `.cloude_uploads` bucket from the project folder.
 * See the CONFIRM_COPY docblock below for the full per-path breakdown -
 * that is the authoritative account, and the dialog copy is written from
 * it. Do not describe either action as leaving disk untouched.
 *
 * SEGREGATION IS THE POINT: a row offers exactly one of the two, never
 * both, chosen from its activity status. A running row gets the X; a
 * stopped row gets the trash. Offering both would ask the user to
 * understand a distinction the row's own state already answers.
 *
 * Why a module and not two copies of the markup: before this, the
 * launcher inlined its own X SVG with an aria-label and no title (no
 * hover tooltip at all) while the sidebar drew a trash can labelled
 * "Delete session" for the identical operation. Same click, two glyphs,
 * two names, one of them silent on hover. One builder ends that class of
 * drift for good.
 *
 * Load order: AFTER session-status-ui.js (uses its glyphs), BEFORE
 * launchpad.js and session-sidebar.js (both call into this).

     * Run the destructive action against the server.
     *
     * Description: THE one place the two destruction endpoints are chosen
     *   between, so a new surface cannot invent a third way to kill a
     *   tmux session. The branch is on whether a session id resolved, NOT
     *   on which glyph was clicked - see the CONFIRM_COPY docblock for
     *   what each path actually destroys.
     *
     *   The launcher (`launchpad.js`) and the sidebar
     *   (`session-sidebar.js`) still inline this same two-line branch.
     *   They should call this instead; that is deliberately not done in
     *   this change because both files are being edited on another branch
     *   right now, and a merge conflict in a destruction path is a worse
     *   outcome than a duplicated `if`.
     * Inputs:
     *   tmuxName (string) - literal tmux session name.
     *   sessionId (string|null) - id of the live backend bound to that
     *     name, when there is one.
     * Output:
     *   Promise<object> - the server's SuccessResponse.
     * Example:
     *   await perform('cloude_api', null)  // DELETE /sessions/external/...
     */
