/**
 * THE PROJECT CARD - one project rendered as a bordered card, with the
 * two counts that project actually has and an affordance that opens the
 * rest of the detail in a modal.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE FILE FROM archive-nav-row.js. That file is the
 * rail's VOCABULARY - the node kinds, the labels, the NOT KNOWN literal,
 * the refusal renderer - and it was at 387 lines against this repo's
 * 500-line cap. Everything here is about ONE kind of node, the project,
 * and it is the only kind that is a card. archive-nav-row.js still owns
 * host, corpus and unattributed rows and still owns every primitive this
 * file builds on; it delegates the project kind here and nothing else.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE TWO COUNTS ARE NOT TWO NUMBERS. THEY ARE ONE SENTENCE.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The rail used to render `transcript_count` and call it the project's
 * size. It is not: 19,588 of 21,039 transcripts corpus-wide (93.1%,
 * measured 2026-08-31) are AGENT SIDECHAIN files written by subagents,
 * not conversations anybody had. So a card read "718" while the middle
 * column - which defaults to `session_ref_scheme = uuid`, "My sessions"
 * - showed 27 for the same project. Two numbers that disagreed, side by
 * side, with nothing on screen explaining why.
 *
 * The owner's instruction was explicit: "so sessions i agree, we should
 * find an eloquent way to show both, but in reality its my sessions i
 * care about." So the card renders ONE SENTENCE, not two figures:
 *
 *     27 sessions   of 718 transcripts
 *
 * The word `of` is doing the whole job. It makes the total read as the
 * SET THE SESSIONS ARE DRAWN FROM rather than as a competing measure of
 * the same thing, which is the exact confusion two bare numbers create.
 * The sessions half is accent-coloured, larger and first; the total is
 * muted, smaller and second. THE TWO ARE NEVER DISTINGUISHED BY COLOUR
 * ALONE - they carry different NOUNS, and the connective sits between
 * them - because three themes zero every radius token and a fourth may
 * flatten the accent.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE SESSION COUNT IS NOT AVAILABLE FROM THE SERVER TODAY, AND THE
 * CARD SAYS SO RATHER THAN SUBSTITUTING THE ONE THAT IS.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Measured 2026-09-02 against the live dev instance: GET
 * /api/v1/archive/projects returns 77 nodes whose keys are exactly
 * display_name, full_path, host_count, hosts, members, observed_cwd,
 * project_id and transcript_count. There is NO per-project session
 * count anywhere in that payload or its meta.
 *
 * The number exists per-project - GET
 * /archive/projects/<id>/transcripts?session_ref_scheme=uuid&limit=1
 * answers meta.filters.matched_in_scope - but reaching it means 77
 * requests to paint one rail, which is an N+1 on the first paint of the
 * only way into the archive. It is not done, and the total is NOT shown
 * in its place under a `sessions` label, because a substituted number
 * is a verdict nobody measured. Until the merged endpoint carries the
 * field, the sessions half renders NOT KNOWN and names why in its
 * tooltip. See SESSION_COUNT_FIELDS for the exact field this consumes
 * the moment it appears.
 *
 * THREE OUTCOMES, NOT TWO, on that count: measured, never reported, and
 * reported-as-unmeasurable are three different findings. The last two
 * both render NOT KNOWN - a person cannot act differently on them - but
 * they carry different `data-session-state` values and different
 * tooltips, so the distinction survives into anything that inspects it.
 *
