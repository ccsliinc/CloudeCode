# convention already used by src/config.py's own `Settings()` construction
# below - a clear banner to stderr (captured by the Electron app's own
# logs, which is what actually shows the user a startup failure - this
# app has no server-rendered "error page" route), a copy written to a
# throwaway diagnostic log for local debugging, then a hard, immediate
# process exit. This is intentionally NOT a silent fallback to /tmp and
# NOT an unhandled traceback - it is a named, described failure.

CLOUDE CODE - STATE DIRECTORY ERROR

The server refuses to start rather than write your session data,
pinned themes, unread flags, or refresh tokens somewhere you did not
choose (or silently drop them in a temp directory that macOS purges on
reboot).

To fix:
1. Make the target directory writable, or
2. Set CLOUDE_STATE_DIR in .env to a writable path, then restart.

# including those produced by CORS preflight, static files, and the
# catch-all SPA route - so we register it here, after CORS. On response
# path it runs last, giving us a single place to stamp headers on
# anything the app returns (including errors).
#
# Policy rationale for a local / LAN-only SPA:
# - `default-src 'self'` - lock everything to same-origin by default.
# - `script-src 'self'` - no inline or eval; all JS ships from /static.
#   xterm.js and its addons used to load from cdn.jsdelivr.net; they are
#   now vendored under client/vendor/xterm/ (see that dir's VERSION.md)
#   and served same-origin, so the CDN host is no longer needed here.
# - `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'` - xterm addons (webgl, fit) inject
#   inline style attributes on DOM nodes they manage. Without
#   `'unsafe-inline'` the terminal renders blank. This is the smallest
#   concession that keeps the terminal usable. cdn.jsdelivr.net dropped
#   here too now that xterm.css is vendored same-origin.
# - `connect-src 'self' ws: wss:` - WebSocket terminal stream runs on
#   the same origin; allow ws:/wss: so future tunnels (Cloudflare named)
#   with a different scheme can still connect.
# - `img-src 'self' data:` - data: URIs are used for QR codes / emoji SVGs.
# - `font-src 'self' data:` - xterm embeds icon fonts as data: URIs. This
#   never actually needed cdn.jsdelivr.net (xterm.css references no
#   remote font URL), so nothing changes here beyond the comment being
#   made honest.
# - `frame-ancestors 'none'` - clickjack defense; Cloude Code is never
#   meant to be iframed.

    """StaticFiles subclass that forces revalidation on .html, .js and .json assets.

    Why: mobile browsers (iOS Safari in particular) aggressively heuristic-
    cache JS served over LAN HTTP with no ``Cache-Control`` header. That
    was producing a ghost bug where a phone would render a pre-v3.1
    ``launchpad.js`` bundle that predates the running-sessions feature,
    so the section silently stayed hidden.

    Fix: stamp ``Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate`` on HTML, JS and
    JSON responses. ``no-cache`` still allows caching but forces a
    conditional GET (If-None-Match / If-Modified-Since) on every load, so
    the browser gets an instant 304 when the file is unchanged and the new
    bytes when it isn't. ``.css`` was added after a stale stylesheet proved NOT to be merely
    cosmetic: a deployed fix removed an ``overflow: hidden`` that was
    clipping hover tooltips, and returning browsers kept the cached sheet,
    so the affected controls stayed unreadable until a manual hard reload.
    Images and fonts keep the browser default; they version rarely and
    are not load-bearing for interaction.

    ``.json`` is on the list as of Phase 9 (theme system): ``theme.json``
    files served from ``/static/css/themes/<id>/`` and ``/themes/<id>/``
    are user-edited at runtime, and iOS Safari was caching them across
    sessions - flipping a manifest's CSS vars and requiring a hard reload
    to see the change. Same revalidation strategy as JS/HTML.

    Applied via subclass rather than ASGI middleware because (a) it only
    runs on static hits, (b) it can't accidentally leak Cache-Control
    onto API JSON responses, and (c) it sidesteps any ordering tangles
    with the existing CSP middleware.

# Pin .m4a to audio/mp4 BEFORE any StaticFiles mount is constructed.

# Python's mimetypes table maps .m4a to `audio/mp4a-latm`, and Starlette's
# FileResponse takes the served Content-Type straight from that table. But
# `audio/mp4a-latm` (RFC 6416) names raw MPEG-4 audio in LATM/LOAS transport
# syntax - a bare elementary stream with NO container. Our theme beds are the
# opposite thing: `file` reports "ISO Media, Apple iTunes ALAC/AAC-LC (.M4A)"
# and the header opens with an `ftyp M4A isomiso2` box, i.e. an MP4 container,
# whose registered type is `audio/mp4` (RFC 4337).
#
# This is not a cosmetic label. Every response here carries
# `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` (see csp_headers), which explicitly
# FORBIDS the browser from correcting a wrong Content-Type by sniffing the
# bytes. So a browser that does not recognise `audio/mp4a-latm` as a
# decodable type has no fallback left and simply refuses the file. The
# hardening header and the bad type combine into a failure neither one
