"""``/api/v1/archive/*`` - read-only HTTP over the ingested transcript archive.

ITS OWN MODULE, like ``corpus_routes.py`` and ``status_routes.py``, for
the same reason: nothing new lands in ``src/api/routes.py``.

THESE ROUTES ARE THIN AND THAT IS ENFORCED, NOT ASPIRED TO. Every handler
does four things: bound its parameters, hand them to ONE function in
``src.core.archive_*`` inside ``asyncio.to_thread``, log, and return what
came back. There is no SQL in this file and no business logic. The core
functions already return the three-outcome envelope, so a route cannot
invent a response shape - and because it cannot, it cannot quietly lose
its third outcome.

``response_model=None`` ON EVERY ROUTE, WITHOUT EXCEPTION. A FastAPI
``response_model`` is a FILTER, not a passthrough: it silently DELETES
any field the model does not declare. This project has been bitten twice,
most recently by ``ThemeManifest`` dropping ``themeCss`` from every
``/api/v1/themes`` response while the value existed the whole way up to
serialization. The envelope's ``unevaluated`` and ``meta`` blocks are
exactly the optional, route-varying structure a response model eats.
``test_archive_read_api.py`` iterates ``router.routes`` and asserts it, so
a route added later without it fails a test rather than a code review.

``Depends(require_auth)`` ON EVERY ROUTE, WITHOUT EXCEPTION. The archive
is a complete record of the owner's work, including 6,240 bodies that
carry credential material.

SQLITE WORK RUNS IN A THREAD. A ``sqlite3`` call blocks, and a measured
1.2 second search on the event loop would stall every live terminal
WebSocket in the process.

SECRETS ARE FLAGGED, NEVER REDACTED, AND NEVER LOGGED. No handler here
logs a query string's matches, a body, or a snippet. Body-bearing routes
log ``body_id`` and ``secret_finding_count`` only.
