# It must happen before anything can rewrite the VERSION file underneath us:
# macOS/bootstrap.js stamps that file on every packaged launch, so an upgraded
# bundle landing while an older server is still running would otherwise make
# the OLD process report the NEW version. That false match is exactly what
# lets an upgrade silently adopt a stale server. See
# src/core/version.py::freeze_startup_version for the full account.

# Session rename
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# v0.7.1 - PATCH /sessions/{session_id}/name renames a live tmux session
# on the ``-L cloude`` socket via ``tmux rename-session`` and broadcasts a
# ``session.renamed`` WS event so every browser bound to that session id
# updates its displayed name + ``document.title``. See SessionManager's
# ``rename_session`` for the re-keying semantics (owned set, pinned-themes
# map, session metadata).
#
# A SESSION NAME IS A LABEL, AND A LABEL IS NOT THE TMUX NAME.
# This endpoint used to call ``tmux rename-session``, which moves
# ``tmux_name`` - the field ``(socket, name, epoch)`` identity is keyed
# on. The stored row then matched no live listing row, was reaped as
# ``tmux_missing``, and the same live session came back through the
# adopt path as a stranger and got a SECOND row. One session, two rows,
# one of them a corpse.
#
# It now writes ``sessions.title`` and stops. The tmux name a session is
# created with is the tmux name it keeps, so no user-facing path can
# move identity. The old ``^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}$`` charset is gone with
# it: that regex existed to keep the value safe inside a tmux target and
# a FIFO filename, and a label is never handed to either. Labels take
# spaces, punctuation and mixed case; ``session_label.validate_label``
# refuses only what cannot be rendered (empty, or a control character).
#
# ``SessionManager.rename_session`` is deliberately NOT deleted. An
# external ``tmux rename-session`` is still possible, and the lifecycle
# reconciler still heals it - see src/core/session_lifecycle.py's rename
# pass. What changed is that no user action reaches that path.

    below had already stopped being able to produce. The comment block
    above this function explained the new design correctly the whole time,
    which is exactly how a stale docstring survives - the accurate prose
    sat next to it and nobody re-read the paragraph underneath.

    Validates ``new_name`` with ``session_label.validate_label``: at most

    There is no 409: two sessions may carry the same label, because a

    Claude a path to something it can read for itself. Images keep the
    stricter contract (magic-byte cross-check, tighter size cap); everything
    else is size-capped and name-sanitised but its bytes are never parsed.
    See ``src/api/uploads.py`` for the full validation contract.

    The validated file is written to
    ``<working_dir>/.cloude_uploads/<uuid8>-<safe_name>`` with mode 0o600
    (directory 0o700), via ``O_EXCL`` so nothing is silently overwritten. The
    client then injects the returned absolute ``path`` into the terminal.

    TWO PATHS, ONE HANDLER. ``/sessions/upload-file`` is the canonical route.
    ``/sessions/upload-image`` is retained (and hidden from the schema)
    because this is a PWA: a browser holding a cached older ``api.js`` would
    otherwise 404 on every paste until its service worker updated.

    ``session_id`` (query, optional) picks which session's working dir to
    write into; omitted uses the current session. The terminal tab that's
    pasting passes its own session id so the file lands in the right project.

    Raises:
        HTTPException: 409 if no matching session, 400 on validation failure
            (oversize, empty, or an image failing its magic-byte check), 500
            on disk error.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Single endpoint:
#   POST /hooks/claude-event
#
# Auth model:
#   This endpoint INTENTIONALLY does NOT use Depends(require_auth). The hook
#   subprocess is spawned by Claude Code from inside a tmux pane that runs
#   on the same machine as cloudecode - there's no place for a JWT. Instead
#   we authenticate via TWO orthogonal layers:
#
#     1. Loopback-only - client_host must be 127.0.0.1 (or ::1/localhost).
#        Anything else is rejected with 403.
#     2. HMAC bearer token - a per-session URL-safe token (32 bytes,
#        secrets.token_urlsafe) minted at session-create and injected into
#        the spawned agent's env as CLOUDECODE_HOOK_TOKEN. The hook
#        forwards it via the X-Cloudecode-Token header. We validate via
#        SessionManager.validate_hook_token() which uses hmac.compare_digest.
#
# Both layers must pass. The token is dropped from memory when the session
# is destroyed; the loopback check protects against LAN attackers who
# somehow learn a token (e.g. via a /proc dump on a multi-user box).


# feat/hook-driven-status - the endpoint now accepts every managed event,
# not just the three toast-worthy ones. TOAST_EVENTS still get a toast +
# WS broadcast (unchanged behavior); ACTIVITY_ONLY_EVENTS update ONLY the
# activity-status state machine (src/core/session_activity.py) - no toast,
# no broadcast, since PreToolUse/PostToolUse fire on every tool call and
# would spam the toast UI. Single source of truth for both sets lives in

# which hooks to install), so the whitelist here can never drift from what

# the app is broken.

# It was removed rather than shipped, because shipping the script would not

# and this process is never its own supervisor:
#
#   - packaged: macOS/server-manager.js spawns and owns the python child and
#     already has restart(). reset.sh's fallback branch is stop.sh + start.sh,
#     which would kill that child (server-manager.js's exit handler flags any
#     exit it did not request as lastExitUnexpected, so the tray would report
#     a crash that did not happen) and spawn a detached uvicorn nothing owns,
#     left holding the port after the app quits. A quiet wrong state in place
#     of a loud correct error is the trade this repo's three-outcome rule
#     exists to forbid.
#   - launchd-managed: launchctl kickstart -k is launchd's own job, which is
#     what reset.sh defers to when it can.
#   - from source: ./reset.sh, still in the tree and still what
#     scripts/upgrade_lib/upgrade_rollback_common.sh::start_service runs.
#
# reset.sh is therefore no longer INVOKED by the app, which is why its entry
# in tests/test_runtime_script_delivery.py's ACCEPTED_UNDELIVERED register was
# deleted rather than reworded - that register fails an entry that has become
# permanently true. Re-adding this endpoint puts reset.sh back in the invoked

      THE STORED RECORD IS THE CANDIDATE SET, NOT THE ANSWER. It is a
      snapshot written once, at import time, and every answer the user
      gives happens afterwards on ``sessions``. Reading it back verbatim
      is what made "adopt all" leave the card on screen: the five rows
      were genuinely ``adopted``, stamped at the second he clicked, and
      the prompt re-rendered the snapshot that could not know it. So the
      list is re-derived on every request against
      ``attribution_settled_instances``, and no future path that answers
      an attribution question has to remember to prune anything.

      WHAT IS NOT PRUNED, deliberately. A candidate we cannot cross
      reference - no epoch in the record, no rows table to ask, or no row
      at all - stays in the list. None of those is evidence the question
      was answered, and dropping one would trade a card that will not
      clear for a question that vanished unanswered, which is the same
      defect pointed the other way.

      A row the user has already declined never appears here: the decline
      route writes ``user_declined_at``, which takes it out of the
      derivation above, so the prompt does not return on every boot.
    Inputs: request (Request) - unused beyond auth.
    Output: SessionAttributionPrompt. ``unavailable`` when the datastore
      could not be read, which is NEVER rendered as an empty prompt: an
      empty question set and an unreadable one look identical to a user
      and mean opposite things.
