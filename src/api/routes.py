# It must happen before anything can rewrite the VERSION file underneath us:
# macOS/bootstrap.js stamps that file on every packaged launch, so an upgraded
# bundle landing while an older server is still running would otherwise make
# the OLD process report the NEW version. That false match is exactly what
# lets an upgrade silently adopt a stale server. See

      session - it cannot do anything else, because the old pane is gone
      and the new one necessarily gets a new ``#{session_created}`` - but
      it does NOT create a new session record. The existing row is moved

      ``sessions.id`` and ``session_uuid`` and, with them, its TITLE, its
      working directory, its agent and model, its Claude CONVERSATION
      (continued with a bare ``--resume <uuid>``), its group membership
      and everything that references it. See
      src/core/session_restart.py: rebind_instance for why that is safe,
      and resume_arguments for why the fork flag is gone.

      ONE SESSION, ONE ROW, ONE LIST ENTRY. Inserting a second row was
      what left an abandoned twin holding the user's title and
      conversation while the live session wore a copy of the name, which
      is what doubled the session list on every restart.

      KEYED ON ``session_uuid``, NOT ON THE TMUX NAME. A tmux name is
      reusable and this app re-mints them; resolving a stopped session by
      name could match a LIVE session that took the name afterwards.

        201, ``conversation='none_recorded'`` - the row never learned a
             Claude session uuid. The session still comes back, carrying
             the name/dir/agent, and the response SAYS it is a new
             conversation. Never presented as a resume.

      ``row_reused`` is reported separately and is read back from the row
      itself rather than taken from the create path's own report.

    ``include_scrollback`` (query, optional, default False) - when True

    session" path so the client can paint pre-existing history into
    xterm before the WS opens, mirroring the adopt path. Off by default
    so existing callers see no change.

    ``cols`` / ``rows`` (query, optional) - when ``include_scrollback`` is
    True AND both are positive ints, the pane is pre-resized to the
    client's xterm geometry BEFORE the capture call. ``tmux capture-pane``
    snapshots at the pane's CURRENT width, which is whatever the most-
    recent attached client set it to. Without this pre-resize, a mobile

    eliminates that mismatch. The subsequent WS-handshake resize becomes
    a no-op (same dims) on this client; other attached clients see a

    The counterpart to ``DELETE /sessions/external/{name}``: that one

    the pane, its id, its scrollback and this app's ``pipe-pane`` alive
    when the agent exits, so nothing here creates a session - it puts a
    process back into the one that is already there. The session's row,
    project attribution, pinned theme, unread state and name all survive
    because the instance triple they are keyed on does not change, and
    this path issues no database write at all.

    NOT A FORK. A fork mints a new ``sessions`` row and sets
    ``parent_session_id`` / ``fork_kind``. A respawn cannot mint one -
    ``#{session_created}`` is unchanged, so there is no new instance for a
    row to key on - and it never writes either column.

    NO COMMAND CROSSES THIS BOUNDARY. The body carries a session name and
    optionally an ``agent_type``. What gets run is decided server-side by
    the ladder in ``src.core.session_respawn``, gated on tmux's own
    ``#{pane_start_command}``. Accepting a command from the client would
    make this a create wearing a restart's clothes.

    AN ``agent_type`` IS NOT A COMMAND, which is why it is safe here. It
    is an id that must match a launch wrapper the user has already
    configured on this machine; the server resolves it to a command
    itself, and an id that is not in that list is a 400 rather than a
    silent fall back to the default wrapper - see
    ``src/core/session_agent_choice.py``. It exists because moving a
    session onto another wrapper used to require hand-editing
    ``sessions.agent_type`` in cloude.db.

    REPLACING WHAT IS RUNNING IS A SEPARATE, EXPLICIT REQUEST.
    ``confirm_restart_live`` is what turns this into ``respawn-pane -k``:
    the pane's process is killed and a new one started in the same pane,
    keeping the tmux name, the ``sessions`` row and therefore the project
    attribution, pinned theme, unread state, group filing and sidebar
    position - nothing is re-carried because nothing moves.

    IT IS A PERMISSION AND ONLY THE CLIENT CAN GRANT IT. The preview's
    ``projected`` rung says what a live session would come back AS, and
    that is a PREDICTION: it cannot be echoed back as this flag, and the
    server derives the flag from nothing. Without it a live pane still
    answers ``kind='not_dead'`` and tmux itself refuses the respawn.

    ASK BEFORE YOU ACT. ``GET /sessions/restart/preview``
    (``src/api/restart_routes.py``) reports which rung this session would
    land on, for every configured wrapper, without spawning anything.
    That is what lets a client warn that an empty ``pane_start_command``
    means a plain restart returns a LOGIN SHELL.

    WHY A REFUSAL IS STILL A 200. ``ok=false`` with
    ``kind='cannot_determine'`` means the SERVER worked perfectly and the
    PANE could not be read. A 500 there would blame the server for a state
    it correctly detected, and would push the client into an error path
    instead of showing the user the sentence that says what is unknown.
    The only 4xx here is a name tmux would misread as a target.

# Session rename
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# v0.7.1 - PATCH /sessions/{session_id}/name renames a live tmux session
# on the ``-L cloude`` socket via ``tmux rename-session`` and broadcasts a
# ``session.renamed`` WS event so every browser bound to that session id
# updates its displayed name + ``document.title``. See SessionManager's
# ``rename_session`` for the re-keying semantics (owned set, pinned-themes
# map, session metadata).
#
# A SESSION NAME IS A LABEL, AND A LABEL IS NOT THE TMUX NAME.
# This endpoint used to call ``tmux rename-session``, which moves
# ``tmux_name`` - the field ``(socket, name, epoch)`` identity is keyed
# on. The stored row then matched no live listing row, was reaped as
# ``tmux_missing``, and the same live session came back through the
# adopt path as a stranger and got a SECOND row. One session, two rows,
# one of them a corpse.
#
# It now writes ``sessions.title`` and stops. The tmux name a session is
# created with is the tmux name it keeps, so no user-facing path can
# move identity. The old ``^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}$`` charset is gone with
# it: that regex existed to keep the value safe inside a tmux target and
# a FIFO filename, and a label is never handed to either. Labels take
# spaces, punctuation and mixed case; ``session_label.validate_label``
# refuses only what cannot be rendered (empty, or a control character).
#
# ``SessionManager.rename_session`` is deliberately NOT deleted. An
# external ``tmux rename-session`` is still possible, and the lifecycle
# reconciler still heals it - see src/core/session_lifecycle.py's rename
# pass. What changed is that no user action reaches that path.

    # that was never adopted.

    # failure available here, because the user retries an operation that

    below had already stopped being able to produce. The comment block
    above this function explained the new design correctly the whole time,
    which is exactly how a stale docstring survives - the accurate prose
    sat next to it and nobody re-read the paragraph underneath.

    Validates ``new_name`` with ``session_label.validate_label``: at most

      * 404 - no tmux session this app has a record of
      * 200 - success; body is the updated ``SessionInfo``

    There is no 409: two sessions may carry the same label, because a
    label identifies nothing. There is no 500 for a failed tmux rename,
    because no tmux rename happens.

    On success the server broadcasts ``session.renamed`` to every WS bound

    Description: writes ``sessions.notifications_muted`` and steps
      ``sessions.notification_policy_generation``, then updates the
      in-memory policy projection the notification producers read so the
      change takes effect immediately rather than at the next boot.

      IT IS A STATE, NOT A TOGGLE. Sending ``{"muted": true}`` twice
      commits once and reports the same answer both times. A toggle would
      make a retry, a double click, or a second open tab flip the setting
      to whatever the race decided.

      THE GENERATION IS WHY THIS RETURNS MORE THAN "ok". Every queued
      notification carries the generation it was raised under, and the
      dispatcher refuses anything that is not current. So this response's
      ``policy_generation`` is what makes "an old alert cannot escape a
      mute/unmute cycle" checkable from outside the server.

      MUTING ACKNOWLEDGES NOTHING. It records a delivery preference and
      touches no toast, no unread flag and no activity state. In
      particular a pending PERMISSION request stays open and the session
      keeps reporting ``question``: claude is still blocked mid-turn
      waiting on a human, and a mute that quietly marked that answered
      would strand it behind a yes/no nobody was ever told about.

      IT DOES NOT REPLAY A BACKLOG EITHER. Unmuting resumes FUTURE alerts
      only. What was suppressed was never queued for later; what was
      already queued is invalidated by the generation step.

      ADDRESSED BY ``session_uuid``, and optionally checked against an
      expected tmux instance - see ``MuteNotificationsRequest`` for why a
      row action fired from a painted list needs that second key.
    Inputs: request (Request) - unused beyond auth. session_uuid (str,
      path) - the row. body (MuteNotificationsRequest).
    Output: NotificationPolicyResponse - the COMMITTED state and
      generation, read back rather than echoed.
    Raises: HTTPException 404 - no row carries that uuid, or the database
      predates schema v26 so there is nowhere to record this.
      HTTPException 409 - the row is not the tmux instance the caller
      named, so the list it was clicked from was stale.

    Description: STAGE C. The import decides silently only where tiers 1
      to 4 PROVE a session is ours. Everything else lands here, with the
      hints spelled out in words, and the user answers once.

      WHY THIS IS NOT FOLDED INTO GET /sessions/import-status. That route
      answers "has the import run"; this one answers "is there anything
      left to ask you". They can disagree in both directions - a
      completed import can still leave questions, and a pending one
      leaves none because it has not looked yet - so collapsing them
      would make one of the two answers unreadable.

      THE STORED RECORD IS THE CANDIDATE SET, NOT THE ANSWER. It is a
      snapshot written once, at import time, and every answer the user
      gives happens afterwards on ``sessions``. Reading it back verbatim
      is what made "adopt all" leave the card on screen: the five rows
      were genuinely ``adopted``, stamped at the second he clicked, and
      the prompt re-rendered the snapshot that could not know it. So the
      list is re-derived on every request against
      ``attribution_settled_instances``, and no future path that answers
      an attribution question has to remember to prune anything.

      WHAT IS NOT PRUNED, deliberately. A candidate we cannot cross
      reference - no epoch in the record, no rows table to ask, or no row
      at all - stays in the list. None of those is evidence the question
      was answered, and dropping one would trade a card that will not
      clear for a question that vanished unanswered, which is the same
      defect pointed the other way.

      A row the user has already declined never appears here: the decline
      route writes ``user_declined_at``, which takes it out of the
      derivation above, so the prompt does not return on every boot.
    Inputs: request (Request) - unused beyond auth.
    Output: SessionAttributionPrompt. ``unavailable`` when the datastore
      could not be read, which is NEVER rendered as an empty prompt: an
      empty question set and an unreadable one look identical to a user
      and mean opposite things.
