"""
API routes for the Claude-config file tree + editor (see
``src/core/config_files.py`` for the actual list/read/write logic and
the allowed-roots / hide-list constants — this module is deliberately
thin: request/response shape, auth, and error translation only).

Mounted under ``/api/v1`` from ``src/main.py`` alongside the other
routers. Every endpoint requires ``Depends(require_auth)`` — this is
config content, not public data.

Security note: request bodies/params are logged only at the field-name
level (never file content) — see the ``logger.info`` calls below and in
``config_files.write_file``.
