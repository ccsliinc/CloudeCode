"""The gate that decides whether a search PREVIEW may be served.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS. ``archive_search`` used to withhold a snippet on
``message_bodies.secret_finding_count > 0``. That is a proxy for "this
body contains a credential", and it was MEASURED wrong on 2026-08-31:
one credential (``value_sha256`` 0236d0f5...) sits in 762 bodies, and
415 of them carry ZERO findings, so 21 of 43 hits in a single
``transcript_id=4`` search returned it in cleartext.

THE ROOT CAUSE IS NOT STALE FINDINGS. Re-scanning the 415 unflagged
bodies with TODAY's detectors produced 0 findings for that credential,
and all 347 flagged bodies still flag - the stored flags are exactly
faithful to the current code. The value is 40 characters with no vendor
marker, so only ``high_entropy_assignment`` can see it, and that
detector is CONTEXTUAL: it needs a name that says "token"/"secret"/"key"
immediately before the value. Measured over every occurrence: all 533
detected ones sit in that assignment context and all 587 occurrences in
unflagged bodies do not. The gap is STRUCTURAL, so no re-scan closes it
and re-running the detectors over the snippet window closes it either -
a window is a subset of the body, and the body already scans clean.

WHAT THIS GATE ACTUALLY GUARANTEES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT.

  GUARANTEED (hard, not best-effort): a value that this corpus has ever
  detected as a credential ANYWHERE will not appear in a snippet, even
  in a body that carries no finding of its own. That is layer 3, and it
  is what closes the measured defect. It works by hash membership - the
  index holds the sha256 and the length of every known credential and
  NEVER the value, so this module cannot leak what it is protecting.

  BEST EFFORT (stated, not claimed away): a credential this corpus has
  NEVER detected anywhere is not known to layer 3 and is invisible to
  layers 1 and 2 by the same recall limit that caused the defect. No
  gate here can promise otherwise. Callers who need a hard guarantee
  must ask for no snippets at all.

  NEVER SUPPRESSED: withholding a preview never suppresses the hit. The
  transcript, line, offset and length are reported either way.

THE THIRD OUTCOME IS A WITHHOLD. If the index cannot be built the gate
returns ``withheld_gate_unavailable``. "I could not evaluate whether
this is safe" must never render as "this is safe".
