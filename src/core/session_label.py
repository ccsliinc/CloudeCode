"""The user-facing LABEL, and the lossy filter that derives a tmux name.

TWO THINGS THAT WERE ONE THING. A session's displayed name and its tmux
session name were the same string, so renaming a session meant
``tmux rename-session``, which moves the one field the identity key
``(socket, name, epoch)`` was built on. The stored row stopped matching
the live listing, the reaper called it dead, and the same live session
came back through the adopt path as a stranger and got a second row. One
session, two rows, one of them a corpse.

Separating them does not patch that path - it makes it UNREACHABLE from
the rename surface. A label lives in ``sessions.title``. Changing it
writes one column. The tmux name and the creation epoch never move, so
the identity triple is never touched by a rename at all.

It also removes a restriction the user asked to have removed: the old
rename endpoint enforced ``^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,64}$``, so "Media
Compression" was not a legal session name. A label is a label; it takes
what a human types.

WHAT WAS MEASURED ABOUT TMUX, RATHER THAN ASSUMED. On a throwaway socket,
``new-session -s`` ACCEPTED every one of: a space, ``:``, ``.``, ``/``,
``"``, ``$``. So tmux is far more permissive than the old validator
implied. Two real constraints remain:

  NON-ASCII IS NOT PRESERVED. A session created as ``emoji 🚀 ok`` reads
  back from ``list-sessions`` as ``emoji __ ok``. tmux mangles it, so a
  derived name containing one would not round-trip and every lookup by
  name would miss.

  ``:`` AND ``.`` ARE TARGET SYNTAX. tmux's ``-t`` grammar splits on
  them, so a name carrying either is legal to CREATE and awkward to
  ADDRESS - which is what every other call site in this codebase does.

Neither constrains the LABEL, because the label is never handed to tmux.

THE FILTER IS LOSSY AND THEREFORE NOT AN IDENTITY. ``client: acme`` and
``client. acme`` both sanitise to ``client_acme``. That is deliberate and
safe here precisely because the tmux name no longer identifies anything
on its own - the row is identified by ``(socket, name, epoch)`` and, for
a rename, by ``(epoch, #{session_id})``. The collision is resolved by
appending a suffix, never by rejecting the user's label, and never by
letting two live sessions share a tmux name.

WHY THIS DOES NOT DISTURB SIDEBAR GROUPS. Group membership is keyed on
``tmux_name`` on purpose: an unadopted tmux session has no ``sessions``
row to key on, so a row-keyed membership could not represent it at all.
That reasoning is untouched here. The tmux name is now MORE stable than
before, not less - nothing renames it after creation - so the group key
is strictly safer than it was.
