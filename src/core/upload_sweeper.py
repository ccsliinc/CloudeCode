"""Periodic mtime-based TTL pruner for browser-paste image uploads.

The image-paste feature drops files into ``<working_dir>/.cloude_uploads/``.
Three layers cooperate to keep that directory from accumulating bytes
indefinitely:

1. ``SessionManager.destroy_session()`` rmtrees the session's bucket on
   the explicit-kill path. Fastest cleanup, runs synchronously.
2. ``SessionManager._sweep_orphan_uploads()`` runs once on lifespan
   startup. Catches buckets left behind by a force-killed previous run
   where layer 1 never executed.
3. This module's ``UploadSweeper`` runs as an asyncio background task
   for the lifetime of the FastAPI app. Wakes every
   ``interval_seconds``, prunes any file whose mtime is older than
   ``ttl_seconds``, and removes the bucket directory if it ends up
   empty. Safety net for long-running servers.

Layers 2 and 3 share their pruning core via ``sweep_now()`` so the
intent stays identical.

Cancellation discipline: ``run()`` catches ``asyncio.CancelledError``
explicitly to log shutdown intent, then re-raises so the FastAPI
lifespan's ``await task`` resolves cleanly. Single-iteration failures
are isolated - a bad project path or permission error logs at WARNING
and the loop continues.

Filesystem I/O (``os.lstat`` / ``os.unlink`` / ``os.scandir``) is
delegated to ``asyncio.to_thread`` so the event loop stays free for
HTTP and WebSocket handlers.

WHY THIS MODULE CARRIES A GUARD AND THE OTHER WRITE SITES DO NOT
----------------------------------------------------------------
This is the only place in ``src/`` that DELETES from a path the
operator supplied. Every other unisolated write site can at worst leave
a stray file behind; this one runs ``unlink`` over every configured
project root on a timer. During a test run that means the developer's
real work, so a wrong answer here is not recoverable by re-running.

A WRITE GUARD IS NOT ENOUGH FOR A DELETE
----------------------------------------
``test_write_guard.assert_test_write_allowed`` answers one question:
"is this destination inside a temp root". That is necessary and it is
not sufficient, because it says nothing about WHAT is being destroyed.
Three independent questions have to be answered before anything is
unlinked, and any one of them coming back unknown is a refusal:

* **Containment** - is the destination somewhere this run is allowed to
  write at all? (the shared guard, under test only)
* **Shape** - is the thing about to be pruned a real ``.cloude_uploads``
  directory sitting directly beneath the base, rather than a symlink
  pointing somewhere else, a regular file, or a path whose leaf is not
  the name we expect? A symlinked bucket is the one construction that
  lets ``iterdir``/``unlink`` reach outside the leaf entirely.
* **Provenance** - do we actually know which projects are configured? A
  sweeper that cannot answer that must delete NOTHING. The tempting
  reading of an unreadable project list is "there are no projects, so
  just do the default dir"; the honest reading is "I do not know what I
  would be touching". ``project_paths=None`` is that state and it
  disables the whole sweep, default dir included.

``sweep_verdict()`` renders all three as a pure query - it resolves and
stats, it never unlinks - so a caller (or a test) can ask about a path
it must not touch. ``_prune_base`` is the only function that deletes,
and it deletes only what ``sweep_verdict`` cleared.
