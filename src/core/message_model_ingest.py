"""Writing a transcript into the v16 message model.

THE ORDER IS STORE, CLASSIFY, GATE - IN THAT ORDER, ALWAYS. Every line
gets an appearance row before anything asks whether it parses, whether it
links, or whether its uuid already means something else. A line that does
not parse is stored raw. A body that conflicts with an existing one under
the same uuid is stored as its own second row. A parent that does not
exist yet does not stop its child from being written. The gate is a
statement about LINKAGE, never about storage - which is the contract's
own rule (docs/message-model-gate.md, "what is stored for a gated item")
and the reason 1,433 dangling parents cannot cost a single message.

FIDELITY IS MEASURED, NOT ASSERTED. For every line the round trip is
actually run (src/core/message_model_store.py's ``line_payload``) and its
output compared to the original text. When they match, the raw line is not stored at all - the
style marker plus the sha256 is the whole record of it. When they do not,
the raw line IS stored and GATE_FIDELITY_CHECK_FAILED is raised. There is
no third path where a line is called stored without that comparison
having run, so ``fidelity_verified`` in this database always means a
comparison actually happened.

WHERE THE PIECES LIVE. The row-level primitives - interning a lookup
value, upserting a body, scanning it for credential material, writing a
finding, running one line's round trip - are in
``src/core/message_model_store.py``. This module owns the ORDER they are
called in, which is the part that has to be read as a sequence.

WHAT THIS MODULE ADDS ON TOP OF message_model_findings. That module is
pure and can only see one transcript's own lines. Three conditions need
the database: a duplicate uuid whose body differs from one already
stored, a parent uuid that exists in no body row anywhere, and a fidelity
failure (which is a property of the round trip, not of the text). Those
three are raised here.
