"""Respawn - restart the agent inside a session whose pane already died.

WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT.

``remain-on-exit on`` (set by ``TmuxBackend.start``) means a session whose
agent exits is not gone. tmux keeps the window, the pane, the pane id, the
scrollback and - measured, see below - the ``pipe-pane`` this app streams
through. What is missing is only the PROCESS. So the repair is to put a
process back in the pane that is already there, which is exactly
``tmux respawn-pane``. Nothing is created and nothing is destroyed.

THIS IS NOT A FORK, AND THE DATABASE CANNOT CONFUSE THE TWO. A session's
durable identity in ``sessions`` is the instance triple
``(tmux_socket, tmux_name, tmux_created_epoch)``. ``#{session_created}`` is
a property of the SESSION, not of the pane's process, and respawning a
pane does not change it (measured on tmux 3.7c: three sessions respawned,
every ``session_created`` byte-identical before and after). So a respawn
matches the SAME row every existing lookup already matched, writes no new
row, and never sets ``parent_session_id`` or ``fork_kind``. A fork creates
a row; a respawn cannot, because there is no new instance for one to key
on. Nothing in this module imports or touches the lineage columns.

THE COMMAND LADDER, AND WHY tmux IS THE GATE.

The question "what should we re-run" has an obvious wrong answer:
``sessions.agent_type``. That column is written on EVERY create,
``auto_start_claude`` or not (see ``SessionManager.create_session``), so a
session the user deliberately opened as a bare console still carries
``agent_type='claude'``. Trusting it would launch an agent into a console
the user believes is his own shell - precisely the "launch something
arbitrary" failure this module exists to avoid.

tmux's ``#{pane_start_command}`` does not have that defect: it is non-empty
if and only if a command was actually handed to the pane. So it is the
GATE, and the app's own record only chooses BETWEEN commands once tmux has
confirmed there was one:

  ``RESPAWN_AGENT``  - tmux recorded a start command AND the app knows this
      session's ``agent_type``. Re-derive through
      ``Settings.get_agent_command``, so a wrapper or CLI path the user has
      changed since the session started is picked up. This is the user's
      actual case: "I exited to update Claude, now start it again" wants
      the UPDATED command, not a byte-replay of the old one.
  ``RESPAWN_REPLAY`` - tmux recorded a start command and the app knows no
      agent_type (an adopted/external session). Respawn with NO command
      argument and let tmux replay its own record verbatim. This avoids
      re-quoting a string tmux stored in its own display quoting, which is
      not round-trippable.
  ``RESPAWN_SHELL``  - the probe SUCCEEDED and the start command is empty,
      which on a working tmux is positive evidence the pane was born as a
      bare login shell. Respawn with no command; tmux starts the default
      shell, which is what the pane had.
  ``RESPAWN_CANNOT_DETERMINE`` - the probe did not answer. We do not know
      what was in the pane and will not guess. The API refuses and the UI
      says so, which is the whole third outcome: "I could not look" is not
      "there is nothing to run".

Note the two refusal-adjacent states are kept apart on purpose.
``RESPAWN_SHELL`` is a positive finding that acts; ``CANNOT_DETERMINE`` is
an absence of evidence that refuses. Collapsing them would either refuse a
console the user can plainly see, or launch a shell into a pane we failed
to read.

A REPLAY CAN RESUME A CONVERSATION, AND THAT HAD TO BE GUARDED.

``RESPAWN_REPLAY`` hands tmux back its own ``#{pane_start_command}``, and
nothing in this app used to look inside that string. Measured on the
owner's box 2026-09-07: of 19 live sessions, 3 carry an explicit
``--resume <uuid>`` in their recorded start command. So a replay CAN
re-run a resume, and a resume against a transcript that has since been
deleted is precisely the incident this project already paid for once -
``claude --resume <unknown-uuid>`` exits immediately, the pane dies, and
the row still reads ``lifecycle='running'``.

:func:`resume_uuid_in` extracts that uuid onto ``RespawnPlan.resume_uuid``
for every rung whose command carries one, and
:func:`refuse_if_transcript_missing` converts a DEFINITE absence into
``RESPAWN_TRANSCRIPT_MISSING``. The filesystem check itself lives in
``src/core/session_transcript_presence.py`` and is performed by the
caller, so this module stays pure. ``unchecked`` never refuses, for the
reason that module documents: not having looked is not evidence of
absence.

PREDICTING A RUNG WITHOUT ACTING, AND WHY IT NEEDED ITS OWN ENTRY POINT.

The ladder above answers "what should we run NOW", and for a live pane it
correctly stops at ``RESPAWN_NOT_DEAD`` before it ever reads
``#{pane_start_command}``. That makes it useless for the question the
restart picker actually has to answer: "if I restart this session, what
will it come back AS?" On this machine that question is the whole point -
18 live sessions, most idle for days, and the ones with a NULL
``agent_type`` are exactly the ones that would come back a bare shell.

So the tail of the ladder is factored into ``_rung_from_start_command``
and reached two ways. :func:`resolve_respawn_plan` reaches it through the
probe gate AND the liveness gate; :func:`project_restart_rung` reaches it
through the probe gate only. There is still ONE ladder, and the entire
difference between the action and the prediction is the liveness gate.

A projected rung is a PREDICTION, NEVER A PERMISSION. Liveness is
reported alongside it as its own fact by :func:`pane_state_from_probe`,
so a caller can say "this would come back as claude-chrome" and "you
cannot restart it while it is running" in the same breath, which is the
honest pair. Nothing here passes ``-k``, so a live agent cannot be killed
by any of it.

NOT DEAD IS ITS OWN OUTCOME. ``RESPAWN_NOT_DEAD`` is returned for a pane
that is alive. Callers never need to enforce it defensively: tmux itself
refuses ``respawn-pane`` without ``-k`` on a live pane (measured: rc=1,
"pane ... still active"), and this module never passes ``-k``. So a click
on a row that came back to life between paint and click cannot kill a
running agent - that is a guarantee from tmux, not a check we wrote.

AN EXPLICIT CHOICE OUTRANKS THE GATE, AND ONLY AN EXPLICIT CHOICE.

``chosen_agent_command`` is the command for a wrapper THE USER PICKED IN
THIS REQUEST, in the restart picker, having been shown what each choice
would do. It is not the same kind of evidence as
``sessions.agent_type`` and must not be treated as such.

Re-read why the gate exists: ``agent_type`` is written on EVERY create,
``auto_start_claude`` or not, so a session the user deliberately opened
as a bare console still carries one. The failure that guards against is
an agent appearing in a pane the USER BELIEVES IS HIS OWN SHELL. That
failure cannot occur when the user has just named the agent, so the gate
has nothing left to protect and the choice wins.

It wins over ``RESPAWN_SHELL`` and over the "no start command recorded"
``RESPAWN_CANNOT_DETERMINE``, because in both of those the missing
information is exactly the information the user supplied. It does NOT
win over ``RESPAWN_NOT_DEAD`` or over a probe that did not answer: those
are facts about whether the pane can be respawned at all, and no choice
of wrapper changes them. Replacing a LIVE session's agent is a different
operation this module does not perform (TODO item 22).

The verdict is still ``RESPAWN_AGENT`` - the outcome really is "an agent
gets launched", and inventing a sixth kind would fork the vocabulary
every consumer validates against. What is added is ``RespawnPlan.chosen``
and a DIFFERENT ``detail`` sentence per case, so the preview can say out
loud that the pane was a bare shell and the choice is about to change
what it runs.

        ONLY A DEFINITE ABSENCE REFUSES. ``present`` and ``unchecked``

        is not evidence that a file is gone - refusing on it would break
        restart on every machine whose corpus lives somewhere the checker
