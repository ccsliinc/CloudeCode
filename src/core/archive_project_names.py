"""Project DISPLAY NAMES and the cross-host MERGED identity.

TWO PROBLEMS, ONE CAUSE. The rail addresses a project by its slug, an
encoded absolute path like
``-Users-jsugamele-Development-Assistants-Infrastructure``. In a 272px
rail that middle-truncates to
``-Users-jsugamele-Develo...t-Assistants-Developer``, which removes
precisely the segment that identifies it. And the same project collected
from two machines appears as two unrelated rows, because the tree is
keyed host -> corpus -> project.

THE SLUG IS A LOSSY ENCODING AND MUST NOT BE PARSED. This is the single
most important fact in this module. The slug replaces ``/`` with ``-``,
but a directory name may itself contain ``-``, and nothing marks which
is which. Measured against the live corpus, 2026-09-01, the slug is
provably NOT invertible:

    slug ...Production-bhpp-new-server   real path .../bhpp_new_server
                                         (underscores, not separators)
    slug ...Development-3D-Work          real path .../3D Work
                                         (a SPACE, destroyed entirely)
    slug ...Production-dev-tools-scripts real path .../tools/dev_tools/scripts
                                         (THREE segments, not two)

Splitting a slug on ``-`` and taking the last element yields ``server``,
``Work`` and ``scripts`` for those three - wrong every time, and wrong in
the direction that invents collisions between projects that do not
collide. So the display name is derived from ``observed_cwd``, which is
the real path and is present for 80 of 80 projects (measured). The slug
is carried through UNPARSED as ``full_path`` for tooltip and detail,
which is the only honest thing to do with a string you cannot decode.

A project whose ``observed_cwd`` is NULL is reported with a null
``display_name`` rather than a guess scraped out of its slug. The caller
renders the slug; it does not get a fabricated folder name.

COLLISIONS ARE REAL BUT RARE, AND MEASURED. Across the 77 distinct
projects there are 69 distinct final segments, so exactly 3 names
collide, covering 11 projects:

    '.claude'  x4   (~/.claude, ~/.dotfiles/.claude,
                     .../bhpp_new_server/.claude, ~/Scratch/.claude)
    'outputs'  x4   (four sibling agent-session dirs, distinguishable
                     only at the ``local_<uuid>`` segment TWO levels up)
    'scripts'  x3   (.../claude_4/scripts, .../dev_tools/scripts,
                     ~/scripts)

``disambiguate`` therefore walks LEFT one path segment at a time and
stops the moment a name is unique, rather than falling back to the whole
slug. ``.claude`` becomes ``.dotfiles/.claude``; ``outputs`` keeps
growing until it reaches the segment that actually differs. A project
with no collision keeps its bare folder name, which is the common case
(66 of 77).

THE MERGE IS KEYED ON ``observed_cwd``, NOT ON THE SLUG. Both were
checked. ``message_projects`` is ``UNIQUE (corpus_id, slug)`` and there
are 2 hosts across 3 corpora, so the same project genuinely appears as
separate rows. Measured: 80 project rows collapse to 77 nodes, and
exactly 3 projects exist on both machines:

    /Users/jsugamele
    /Users/jsugamele/Development/Assistants/Media
    /Users/jsugamele/Development/Assistants/Media/.claude/worktrees/vibrant-leakey-ea30bb

DOES THE SAME SLUG ON TWO HOSTS MEAN THE SAME PROJECT? Checked rather
than assumed: for all 3, the ``observed_cwd`` recorded on each host is
byte-identical. They are the same absolute path on two machines with the
same home layout. That is what justifies merging them, and it is why the
key is the real path - if a future host ever disagrees, the two paths
differ and the projects stay separate rather than being silently fused
on a slug that happened to match.

THE MACHINE IS DEMOTED, NEVER DISCARDED. Each merged node carries
``hosts`` (every machine it appears on) and ``members`` (the underlying
per-corpus project rows, each with its own id and counts), so the
information the old tree encoded as a LEVEL is still addressable as a
FIELD. A node's ``transcript_count`` is the sum across its members, and
``members`` is what a host filter narrows.

      BOTH COUNTS COME FROM ONE GROUPED SCAN, NOT TWO AND NOT 77. The

      would be an N+1 on the only way into the archive (77 requests
      measured). A second grouped query would have been correct but
      wasteful, so the total and the own-session count are produced by
      the SAME statement with a conditional SUM - the route therefore
      issues exactly the number of statements it issued before this
      field existed. Measured on the live corpus 2026-09-02, 21,039

      and this one runs at 4.862ms, so the added cost is 4.10ms and no

      loss of the covering index - ``ix_message_transcripts_project``
      covers ``project_id`` alone, so reading ``session_ref_scheme``
      forces a row fetch. A covering ``(project_id, session_ref_scheme)``
      index would remove it and is deliberately NOT added here, because
      it would mean a new migration step for 4ms.

      THREE OUTCOMES ON THE SESSION COUNT. A project with no uuid-scheme
      transcripts is a measured ZERO. A database whose schema cannot
      answer the question at all - an older archive version without
      ``session_ref_scheme``, say - falls back to the total-only
