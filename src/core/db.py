"""cloude.db - connection handling, pragmas, and the meta key/value store.

Hand-rolled on the Python standard library's ``sqlite3``. NOT SQLAlchemy,
and that is a decision, not an omission:

  * The history viewer that was cited as already loading SQLAlchemy into
    the process does not. It ships SQLAlchemy in a SEPARATE
    requirements-history.txt, deliberately kept out of requirements.txt,
    and imports it lazily at request time.
  * Worse, src/core/history_db.py argues its own read-only guarantee
    partly from the fact that nothing else in the app uses SQLAlchemy at
    all. Adding it here would make that safety argument false the day it
    shipped.
  * The v1 schema is two tables whose DDL is fully written down in
    src/core/db_models.py. A hand-rolled repository layer costs less than
    a new runtime dependency plus greenlet.

PRAGMAS, applied to EVERY connection this module hands out:

  journal_mode=WAL   readers never block the writer and vice versa, which
                     matters because the hooks path and the request path
                     both write. WAL is a persistent property of the file
                     (it survives close), but it is re-asserted per
                     connection because asserting it is idempotent and
                     cheap, and assuming it is exactly the kind of
                     unverified inheritance this codebase keeps getting
                     burned by.
  foreign_keys=ON    per connection, NOT persistent, and off by default.
                     A schema with foreign keys and this pragma unset is
                     a schema whose constraints are decorative.
  busy_timeout=30000 30s. Short transactions plus WAL make contention
                     rare; when it happens, waiting beats raising.

WAL AND COPYING. A cp/rsync/tar of a WAL-mode database while a writer is
live produces a file that OPENS CLEANLY and is missing the last commits,
because those commits are in the -wal sidecar the copy did not take. Every
backup in this subsystem goes through VACUUM INTO instead - see
src/core/db_backup.py, which also carries the test proving the two are
distinguishable.
