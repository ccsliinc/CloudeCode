"""User-editable list of common shell commands for the console tab.

feat/settings-tabs-and-commands — a small, ordered, named list stored in
``config.json`` under the TOP-LEVEL ``terminal_commands`` key. Each entry is
one shell command line the user can run in one click from the settings
panel's "terminal" tab.

SECURITY MODEL, load-bearing, read before changing anything here
-----------------------------------------------------------------
These strings are shell commands and this app is not single-user. They are
therefore NEVER executed server-side. There is deliberately:

  * no ``subprocess.run`` / ``os.system`` / ``eval`` anywhere in this module
    or in any caller that consumes a ``TerminalCommand.command``;
  * no endpoint that accepts a command STRING and runs it. The only
    launch-side input the API accepts is a command ``id`` (see
    ``CreateSessionRequest.terminal_command_id``), which is looked up in
    the user's own config here. A string the client invents cannot reach a
    shell through this path at all.

The single sanctioned consumption path is:

  client sends ``agent_type="shell"`` + ``terminal_command_id="<id>"``
    -> ``Settings.get_terminal_command(id)`` resolves it FROM CONFIG
    -> ``SessionManager.create_session`` starts an ordinary console session
       (``agents.shell_command``, i.e. ``$SHELL -i``)
    -> the resolved text is written into that pane with the EXISTING
       ``SessionBackend.write()`` (tmux ``send-keys``), exactly as if the
       user had typed it.

So the command is typed into a tmux pane the user is looking at and can
Ctrl-C, not exec'd by the server process. If you ever find yourself adding
a "run this command and return its output" endpoint, stop: that is a remote
shell, which is a different product with a different threat model.

Why the console session shells out through ``$SHELL -i``: a non-interactive
shell does NOT source ``~/.zshrc``, so ``claude`` (and the user's ``cld`` /
``cldor`` functions, and Homebrew's PATH entries) are simply not on PATH
there. ``agents.shell_command`` is ``$SHELL -i`` precisely so rc files load
and these commands resolve. This is the same constraint
``Settings.get_agent_command`` documents for its ``zsh -c 'source
~/.zshrc; ...'`` wrapper.
