"""Turning a successful adopt into a durable ``origin='adopted'`` row.

WHAT S4 BUILT AND DELIBERATELY DID NOT WIRE. ``session_identity``
already had the UPDATE and its tests. Nothing called it, because calling
it flips the ownership badge for adopted sessions and the shipped
verifier asserted the opposite. This module is the wire, and
scripts/verify_session_ownership_badge.py moves with it.

THE DECISION THIS ENCODES, which is not up for re-litigation: adopting
an external session makes it OURS, permanently. ``created`` and
``adopted`` both badge as ours; ``observed`` is the only external value.
The distinction is kept in the column and shown on the session detail
surface, so "how did this become mine" is still answerable - it is just
not shouted on every row of the list.

WHY A ROW MAY HAVE TO BE CREATED FIRST. The first-run import is a
one-way latch that ran once, so it recorded the sessions alive at that
moment and nothing since. A tmux session started afterwards is live, is
adoptable, and has NO ROW. Adoption itself must never invent a row - an
invented row would carry an ``origin`` nobody measured - so this module
records the sighting explicitly, as ``observed``, from a listing that
actually ran, and only then claims it. Two statements, two different
facts, in that order:

    record_instance(origin='observed')   we have SEEN this instance
    claim_instance()                     the user has CLAIMED it

WHERE THE THIRD OUTCOME LIVES HERE. Adoption can fail to persist in
ways that are not errors and must not be 500s:

  ``session_gone``          the listing RAN and this instance is not in
                            it. It died between the client's listing and
                            the click. The user needs "that session is
                            no longer there" and a refresh, and NO ROW
                            IS MARKED ADOPTED.
  ``listing_unavailable``   tmux could not be asked. We do not know
                            whether the session is there. Never rendered
                            as gone - that would tell the user his live
                            session had died because a probe timed out.
  ``refused``               the sighting collided with a stored row that
                            provably describes a different session
                            (see session_reconcile). Nothing is claimed.

None of these is reported as success, and none of them is a crash.

        1. THE LISTING GATE. ``ok=False`` carries no rows BY CONTRACT,
           so a missing name proves nothing. Returns
           ``listing_unavailable`` and writes NOTHING.
        2. LIVENESS. The name absent from a listing that RAN means the
           session died between the client's list and its click. Returns
           ``session_gone`` and writes NOTHING - the row must not be
           marked adopted for a process that no longer exists.
        3. THE SIGHTING. ``record_instance(origin='observed')`` so a
           session started after the one-way first-run import has a row
           to claim. Inserts when absent, MERGES when present without
           touching ``origin``, and REFUSES when the stored row provably
           describes a different session.
        4. THE CLAIM. ``claim_instance`` flips ``origin`` to ``adopted``
           and sets ``adopted_at`` first-write-wins.

      ATTRIBUTION RIDES ALONG because this is the one moment the working
      directory is already being read. A probe that fails leaves the
      attribution ``unknown`` and the stored ``working_dir`` untouched -
      never a guess, and never the home directory that
      ``session_manager._resolve_external_cwd`` falls back to for its own
      unrelated purpose.
    Inputs: conn (sqlite3.Connection) - caller owns the transaction.
      socket (str) - the tmux socket. name (str) - the tmux session name.
      listing (TmuxListing) - a FRESH listing taken for this adoption.
      working_dir_probe (callable | None) - name -> directory or None.
      pane_pid_probe (callable | None) - name -> the pane's foreground
      pid, or None. Feeds rule 1 of the claude-uuid correlation ladder
      (see ``_try_correlate_claude_session``); when omitted, rule 1 is

      for fork resolution, resume, and the rename push.

      the timing rule alone. Rule 1 (the pane's own process argv) is the
      only rule that can ever find a RESUMED conversation - a resumed
      conversation predates its pane by construction, so no timing rule
      can find it, and a session recovered after the app's tmux server
      died is exactly that case. Rule 2 (transcript timing) is kept for
      the born-in-pane case, where rule 1 has nothing to find. See that

      ``session_claude_correlate_bind`` for the write-safety properties
      (unique index, never un-archive, never fork) neither rung bypasses.
