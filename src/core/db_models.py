"""Schema definition for cloude.db - DDL, version constant, table names.

This module is pure data. It holds no connection logic, no migration
driver, and no I/O, so it can be imported by a test, a CLI entry point,
or a documentation generator without touching the filesystem.

SCOPE OF SCHEMA v1. Three tables:

  ``meta``            key/value scalars, including ``schema_version``.
  ``migration_trail`` the queryable MIRROR of migration_trail.jsonl.
  ``projects``        one row per project root (design doc section 3.2).
                       Added in build step S3. ``config.json`` stays
                       authoritative for writes; this table shadows it
                       and is read by src/core/project_store.py and the
                       GET /projects/presence route.

SCOPE OF SCHEMA v2. One more table:

  ``sessions``        one row per session (design doc section 3.3).
                       Added in build step S4, as its OWN additive step
                       (v1 -> v2) rather than folded into v1, because by
                       the time it was written v1 had shipped WITH a
                       reader: src/core/project_store.py and the
                       GET /projects/presence route both depend on it.
                       That is the exact condition that closes v1 to
                       further edits.

``projects`` was folded into v1 rather than opening a v2 migration
because, at the time it was added, schema v1 had shipped with no reader
depending on it yet (confirmed against HEAD before this table was
added) - the same condition db_migration.py's docstring already treats
as the bar for "still extendable". Sessions and everything else in
section 3.3 remain deferred to their own additive steps; this file's
job is still to grow ADDITIVELY, never to retype what shipped before.

ADDITIVE ONLY. Every future step may CREATE a table, CREATE an index, or
ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN. No step may ever drop, rename or retype anything.
A step must inspect ``sqlite_master`` / ``PRAGMA table_info`` before it
acts so that re-running it after an interrupted attempt is a no-op rather
than an error - see src/core/db_migration.py.

# THE MOST LOAD-BEARING OBJECT IN THIS SCHEMA, and it costs one integer.

# ``#{session_created}``.

# in the key, the new instance simply does not match, so no statement
# touches the old row: it gets its own row, origin='observed', and the
# old row keeps its adoption history and falls to 'stopped'.
#

#
# WHY A NEW VERSION RATHER THAN AN EDIT TO v2. v2 has shipped and has
# readers. Redefining it in place would leave any file already at v2
# describing a schema the code no longer expects, with nothing to detect
# the difference. So this is its own additive step, per this module's
# additive-only rule.
#
# WHAT IT ADDS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT. One nullable column:
# ``tmux_session_id``, tmux's ``#{session_id}`` (``$0``, ``$1``, ...).
#
# THE IDENTITY KEY IS UNCHANGED. ux_sessions_tmux_instance still keys on
# (tmux_socket, tmux_name, tmux_created_epoch) and this step does not
# touch it. That is a decision, not an omission, and it cuts against the
# obvious reading that session_id is "the real identity":
#
#   session_id is unique per SERVER LIFETIME and restarts at $0 when the
#   server does. $3 today and $3 after a reboot are DIFFERENT sessions
#   with the same id. As a durable key stored on disk it is therefore
#   strictly WORSE than the creation epoch, which does not repeat.
#
#   It is strictly BETTER at separating two sessions that exist at the
#   same moment, which is the one thing a one-second epoch cannot do.
#
# So it is stored as a DISCRIMINATOR, never as a key: it can only ever
# cause a merge to be REFUSED (the stored row names a different live
# session than the one in front of us), never cause one to be accepted.
# A refusal on bad evidence costs one row; an acceptance on bad evidence
# hands one session's history and ownership badge to a stranger. The
# asymmetry decides which way an uncertain answer must fall.
#
# NULLABLE ON PURPOSE. Every row written before this column existed has
# NULL here, and NULL means "not recorded", never "different". The

# ``updated_at`` cannot: GET /projects/presence re-stats every root on

# plain page load and would sort the list by "last probed" while claiming
# to sort it by "last opened".
#
# NULLABLE ON PURPOSE, and NULL means "never opened in this build", never
# "opened at the epoch". Rows imported from config.json carry NULL and
# fall back to their insert order, which IS the config array order, which

# --- v4 -> v5: project_tombstones -----------------------------------------
#
# WHY THIS TABLE EXISTS. The projects import used to run once per install,
# behind the sessions latch, so a project the OLD version created during a
# downgrade never reached the table on re-upgrade and the next
# snapshot_projects() deleted it from config.json too. The fix is to
# reconcile config.json against the table on EVERY start - and that fix is
# only safe if the reconcile can tell these two apart:
#
#   a root absent because it was NEVER IMPORTED      -> import it
#   a root absent because the user DELETED it        -> leave it deleted
#
# Nothing in the v4 schema could. ``delete_project`` is a hard DELETE (see
# its docstring for why, and that reasoning still holds), so a deleted row
# leaves no trace anywhere: no ``deleted_at``, no trail entry, no archive.
# The two cases are BYTE-IDENTICAL to a set comparison. A reconcile built
# on the sets alone would resurrect every deleted project on the next
# start, trading one silent data defect for another.
#
# WHY A SEPARATE TABLE AND NOT A SOFT DELETE. Reusing ``archived_at``
# would leave the row in place, and the row holds the UNIQUE(root). A user
# who deleted a project and then added the same folder back would hit
# ProjectRootConflict from create_project() against a row nothing renders.
# A tombstone keeps ``projects`` meaning exactly what it meant before -
# every row is a live project - and keeps snapshot_projects() honest,
# since it builds config.json from that table and must not learn a second
# exclusion rule.
#
# root is the identity here for the same reason it is in ``projects``:
# display names are mutable and were never unique.

# POST and the fork detector. Without an index that is a full table scan,
# and this table is the one that grows fastest once every fork is a row.
#
# NOT UNIQUE, DELIBERATELY. A UNIQUE index here would turn a duplicate
# hook delivery into an IntegrityError raised out of a telemetry write -
# an exception on a path whose entire contract is that it cannot disturb
# a live session. Uniqueness is enforced by the lookup that precedes the
# insert, where a collision is a NO-OP with a name (``continued``) rather

# ---- schema v7 -> v8: user-defined sidebar groups -------------------------
#
# WHY THIS IS IN THE DATABASE AND NOT IN config.json. Projects were moved
# to DB-only precisely because a second source of truth in config.json
# produced a UI that contradicted itself, and a group model carries the
# same hazard in the same place: the sidebar would have to decide which
# of two disagreeing lists of groups to draw. There is one list, it is
# here, and config.json never learns the word "group".
#
# MEMBERSHIP IS KEYED BY tmux_name, NOT BY sessions.id, and that is the
# decision worth reading. The obvious shape is a nullable
# ``sessions.group_id`` column, and it is wrong here: the sidebar's rows
# come from ``GET /sessions/attachable``, which is a live tmux probe, and
# a tmux session that this install has never adopted HAS NO ROW IN
# ``sessions`` at all. A foreign key to a table that cannot represent the
# thing being grouped is a model that silently cannot hold half the
# user's data - the same shape as this project's own CubeBackup and
# nut-b findings, where the thing that mattered was outside the structure
# doing the enumerating. tmux_name is also exactly the key the sidebar's
# existing pin set and manual order already use, so all three pieces of
# per-row state agree on what identifies a row.
#
# ONE GROUP PER SESSION, ENFORCED BY THE SCHEMA. ``tmux_name`` is the
# PRIMARY KEY of the membership table, so a second membership for the
# same session is impossible at the database level rather than by
# convention. See the module docblock in src/core/session_group_store.py
# for why one-per-session rather than many.
#
# DELETING A GROUP MUST NEVER DELETE A CONVERSATION. ``ON DELETE
# CASCADE`` here deletes the MEMBERSHIP row, which is the only thing this
# table owns; the session itself is not referenced by it and cannot be
# reached from it. So the strongest destructive act available - a raw
# ``DELETE FROM session_groups`` with no application code involved -
# returns those sessions to ungrouped and can do nothing worse. The API
# path does the same thing explicitly; this is the guarantee underneath
# it, not a substitute for it.
