"""Schema definition for cloude.db - DDL, version constant, table names.

This module is pure data. It holds no connection logic, no migration
driver, and no I/O, so it can be imported by a test, a CLI entry point,
or a documentation generator without touching the filesystem.

SCOPE OF SCHEMA v1. Three tables:

  ``meta``            key/value scalars, including ``schema_version``.
  ``migration_trail`` the queryable MIRROR of migration_trail.jsonl.
  ``projects``        one row per project root (design doc section 3.2).
                       Added in build step S3. ``config.json`` stays
                       authoritative for writes; this table shadows it
                       and is read by src/core/project_store.py and the
                       GET /projects/presence route.

``projects`` was folded into v1 rather than opening a v2 migration
because, at the time it was added, schema v1 had shipped with no reader
depending on it yet (confirmed against HEAD before this table was
added) - the same condition db_migration.py's docstring already treats
as the bar for "still extendable". Sessions and everything else in
section 3.3 remain deferred to their own additive steps; this file's
job is still to grow ADDITIVELY, never to retype what shipped before.

ADDITIVE ONLY. Every future step may CREATE a table, CREATE an index, or
ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN. No step may ever drop, rename or retype anything.
A step must inspect ``sqlite_master`` / ``PRAGMA table_info`` before it
acts so that re-running it after an interrupted attempt is a no-op rather
than an error - see src/core/db_migration.py.
