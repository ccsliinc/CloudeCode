"""v0.7.0 Part 3 / feat/hook-driven-status - Claude Code lifecycle hook
settings management.

This module owns the idempotent merge of cloudecode's hook block into
``~/.claude/settings.json``. Called once at FastAPI startup. The hooks
themselves are tiny shell one-liners that POST the event payload (read
from the hook's stdin) to cloudecode's loopback ``/api/v1/hooks/claude-event``
endpoint, carrying the per-session env vars
(``CLOUDECODE_SESSION_ID`` / ``CLOUDECODE_HOOK_TOKEN`` / ``CLOUDECODE_HOOK_URL``)
that were injected into the spawned ``claude`` process's environment via
``TmuxBackend.start(env=...)``.

Security model:
    The hook subprocess can't carry a JWT - there's no place for the user
    to authenticate the hook. Instead the hook proves identity via the
    HMAC-bearer token that ONLY the cloudecode process and the spawned
    agent share (env-injected at tmux session birth). The route ALSO
    requires loopback (127.0.0.1) - defense in depth.

Idempotent merge:
    Each managed hook command embeds the literal marker
    ``# cloudecode-managed`` so on subsequent runs we can identify our
    own hooks vs. anything the user (or another tool) added. We replace
    every managed hook in place; non-managed hooks are left untouched.

Safety:
    - Existing settings file is parsed; if parse fails we LOG and BAIL
      (no clobber of unparseable user config).
    - Write is atomic: write-to-tmp + rename.
    - Opt-out via ``settings.notifications.disable_claude_hooks``.
