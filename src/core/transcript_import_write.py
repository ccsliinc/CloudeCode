"""Turn accepted proposals into rows. THE ONLY CODE HERE THAT WRITES.

Everything upstream of this module - ``transcript_import_facts`` and
``transcript_import_plan`` - is a pure read, so a dry run is not a
special mode with its own code path that could disagree with the real
one. It is the same pass with this module not called.

FOUR GUARANTEES, and each is enforced here rather than promised in a
docstring somewhere else.

  1. A uuid a ``sessions`` row already holds is SKIPPED, never
     overwritten. The check is re-taken inside the write transaction,
     not trusted from the plan, because the plan was built against a
     snapshot and this is a live database with a running app on it.
     ``ux_sessions_claude_uuid`` would refuse the insert anyway; the
     check exists so the outcome is a counted skip rather than an
     exception that aborts the batch.
  2. A project root a ``projects`` row already holds is REUSED, never
     re-created. Same reason, same re-check.
  3. Every row an import writes is ARCHIVED - ``archived_at`` set on the
     session AND on any project it creates. The owner's model is
     "archived items are not visible unless the checkbox is checked", so
     1,100 recovered conversations arrive out of the way and he turns
     them on. Importing them VISIBLE would bury the sessions he is
     actually working in, which is the same harm as losing them.
  4. NOTHING IS INVENTED. The columns an imported row does not know are
     left NULL. See ``transcript_import_plan.IMPORTED_ROW_CONSTANTS``.

DISPLAY NAMES ARE DISAMBIGUATED BY PATH, not by a counter. Two of the
owner's directories are both called ``media-cleanup-qnap`` and two are
both called ``document_catalog``; a project list holding
``media-cleanup-qnap`` and ``media-cleanup-qnap (2)`` tells him nothing
about which is which. The rule walks UP the path one segment at a time -
``media-cleanup-qnap``, then ``personal/media-cleanup-qnap`` - until the
name is unique, which is the only disambiguator that carries the
information the user needs to tell them apart.
