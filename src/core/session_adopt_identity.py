"""What to call a session the user just opened: its stored id, or a new one.

The pure decision behind ``SessionManager.adopt_external_session``'s very
first line. It used to be a literal::

    adopted_id = f"adopted:{name}"

and that literal is a defect whenever the session ALREADY HAS A ROW.

WHAT THE RE-MINT ACTUALLY BREAKS, because "the id looks different" badly
undersells it. ``get_env_for_spawn`` injects ``CLOUDECODE_SESSION_ID``
into the pane's environment at ``new-session`` time, so the agent running
inside that pane presents its CREATE-TIME id on every hook POST for the
rest of its life, and the hook token it carries is bound to that id.
Registering the same live session under a second, invented
``adopted:<name>`` id does not rename anything - it leaves the agent
presenting an id the app now has no token for, and
``HookTokenAuthority.validate`` answers False. Measured on the owner's box
2026-09-08: one session re-minted this way produced **94 hook POSTs
answered 403** in four minutes, none of them retryable from the agent's
side. Note the status - **403, not 410**. A reader grepping for the
stale-session code finds nothing and concludes the hook path is healthy.

THE LADDER IS NOT A SECOND LADDER. ``resolve_session_id`` from
``session_boot_readopt_plan`` is imported and reused verbatim, so
adopt-on-open and the boot re-adopt cannot disagree about what one live
session is called. Inventing a parallel resolver here is how the two
paths would drift into naming the same pane two different things.

WHAT IS STILL DERIVED, and must stay that way. A genuinely external
session - one with no row for its instance triple - has no stored id to
recover, and ``adopted:<name>`` remains exactly right for it. So does a
session whose creation epoch could not be read: with no epoch there is no
instance triple, ``session_store.get_instance`` returns None BY CONTRACT,
and a row that merely shares the NAME describes some other, historical
process. Guessing there would attach a stranger's row to a live pane,
which is a worse failure than a fresh id.

A RECOVERED ID CARRIES A CREDENTIAL; A DERIVED ONE DOES NOT. That is the
whole reason :attr:`AdoptIdentity.rekeyed` exists as a field rather than
being re-derived by the caller from a string prefix. The caller mints a
hook token for a derived id and MUST NOT mint one for a recovered id -
minting rotates the token, and rotating the token is precisely the 403
this module exists to stop. See ``HookTokenAuthority.keep``.
