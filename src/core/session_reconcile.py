"""The RECONCILE branch: refresh a live row, or REFUSE to touch it.

Split out of src/core/session_identity.py, which keeps INSERT and the
adoption claim. The split follows the decision, not the table: this file
holds the one place that can look at a stored row and a live tmux
instance sharing an identity triple and decide they are NOT the same
process. Getting that wrong hands one session's history, and one
session's ownership badge, to a stranger.

TWO REASONS TO REFUSE, AND WHY THERE ARE TWO.

  ID MISMATCH   the stored and incoming ``#{session_id}`` disagree.
                tmux's session id is unique per server lifetime, so this
                PROVES two different sessions where the one-second
                creation epoch cannot. Fires whatever the stored
                lifecycle says, which is the whole point: it is the only
                guard that works in the window between a session dying
                and the next probe noticing.

  STOPPED ROW   the stored row is already ``stopped``, so it cannot be
                the live instance in front of us.

The id check was added because the stopped-only guard covered the RARER
half. Probes are periodic; for most of the interval after a session dies
its row still says ``running``, and a same-second name reuse used to
MERGE into it.

A NULL id means NOT RECORDED, never "different". Both sides must carry
one for the mismatch to fire, so rows predating schema v3 simply fall
back to the stopped-only guard rather than refusing every re-sighting.

      of code with its own log line rather than an early return buried in
      a longer function. The log deliberately names BOTH rows - the
      stored one by id, uuid, origin and adoption stamp, and the incoming
      one by its triple and asserted origin - because a collision that
      only names one of them is not diagnosable.
