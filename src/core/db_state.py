"""The datastore's startup verdict: one object, six named outcomes.

This is what ``ensure_db_migrated()`` returns and what the app hangs on
``app.state.datastore_state`` for the lifetime of the process. It is pure
data - no connection, no I/O - so a route can render it without a chance
of the render itself failing.

SIX OUTCOMES, and four of them are COULD-NOT-EVALUATE states that must
never collapse into each other or into "ok":

  ok                         everything resolved, writes allowed.
  paused_trail_unreadable    migration_trail.jsonl is corrupt past a
                             line. The app BOOTS on the ground-truth
                             versions in meta.schema_version and
                             config.json, and REFUSES to run any further
                             migration or to offer RESTORE/REVERSE. It is
                             emphatically NOT read as "no trail, must be
                             a fresh install", which would re-run every
                             migration over live data.
  degraded_db_unreadable     cloude.db would not open, or failed
                             integrity_check. Read-only, and it SAYS so.
                             Never an empty database rendering as "you
                             have no projects".
  degraded_backup_unverified the pre-migration backup could not be
                             verified, so it is treated as a backup that
                             does not exist. The migration aborted before
                             touching anything live; the data is intact
                             and one version behind.
  degraded_schema_ahead      meta.schema_version is GREATER than this
                             code's CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION. Refuse to
                             write, state BOTH numbers, do not guess and
                             do not migrate backward.
  degraded_migration_failed  a step raised. The transaction rolled back,
                             the version was not stamped, and the trail
                             names the step and its entry_uuid.

THE VERSION FIELDS ARE NEVER NULL. When a version cannot be determined,
the field carries the string ``CANNOT_DETERMINE`` rather than ``null`` or
a plausible-looking integer. A null renders as a blank cell in a UI and a
blank cell is indistinguishable from a healthy zero; a named string is
not. This is the same reasoning the fleet monitoring in this house
applies to every unevaluable check.
