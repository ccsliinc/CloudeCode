"""Forking a session from the GUI: the decisions, and what is NOT touched.

WHAT A GUI FORK IS. The user picks a running session and asks for a fork.
A NEW tmux session is spawned running ``--resume <uuid> --fork-session``
against the parent's Claude conversation, labelled with ``(fork)``
appended, and it gets its OWN row carrying ``parent_session_id``.

THE PARENT IS NOT TOUCHED, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN.
Not archived, not stopped, not marked, not moved. It is still running,
still listed, still resumable, and still forkable again. There is no
"was forked from" state because there is no such state: the process was
never touched. Recording one would be writing a verdict about a session
that is alive, which is the false-green class this codebase keeps
removing. "Was this forked from" is answered by a reverse lookup on
``parent_session_id``, which costs nothing and cannot go stale.

WHY THE CHILD IS AN ANCHOR AND NOT A LINEAGE ROW. ``session_lineage``
gives a past CONVERSATION ``tmux_created_epoch = NULL``, which is what
keeps it out of the partial unique index and out of every reader of tmux
identity. A GUI fork is not a past conversation - it is a live tmux
session that happens to know where it came from. So it carries a real
epoch AND a parent, a shape nothing produced before, and
``session_store.list_sessions`` was taught to tell the two apart.

THE LABEL IS APPEND-ONLY, BY THE OWNER'S EXPLICIT DECISION. A second fork
of a fork is ``name(fork)(fork)``. It is not deduplicated, not numbered,
and not capped. Renaming is the user's job and they said so; inventing a
scheme would be guessing at an intent that was already stated.
