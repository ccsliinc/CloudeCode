"""Carry a name typed into the TUI back to the row the browser shows.

ONE NAME PER SESSION, AND THE TRANSCRIPT IS WHERE THE TWO SIDES MEET.
A session can be renamed from two places and they do not talk to each
other: the browser writes ``sessions.title``, and ``/rename`` typed into
the pane appends a ``custom-title`` record to the conversation's jsonl.
NO HOOK EVENT CARRIES THAT RECORD - measured 2026-09-08, a ``/rename`` in
a live pane wrote the record and the row's title did not move - so the
only way to learn about it is to read the file.

The rendezvous is the transcript, because BOTH sides write to it: the TUI
writes the record directly, and a browser rename writes one indirectly
through the out-of-band ``claude -p --resume <uuid> "/rename ..."`` push
in ``claude_rename``. So this module syncs in ONE direction at the row -
transcript to ``sessions.title`` - and the other direction is the push,
which is a different module's job.

WHY ``sessions.claude_title`` IS THE MARKER AND NOT A NEW COLUMN.
The column already exists (``db_steps._step_v9_to_v10``) and has had zero
readers since the day it was added. It records what CLAUDE last said the
session was called, which is exactly the fact needed to make this
idempotent: apply a title only when it differs from the one already
recorded. The same event twice therefore writes nothing the second time,
which is the property every hook consumer in this codebase has to have -
hook events are unordered, duplicated and droppable.

THE FIRST SIGHT OF A TITLE IS A BASELINE, NOT AN INSTRUCTION.
``claude_title`` starts NULL on every existing row, on purpose: v10
refused to copy ``title`` into it because that would have invented an
attribution. So the first pass over a session can find a ``custom-title``
record with NO WAY OF KNOWING whether it predates or postdates the label
the row currently carries. ``custom-title`` records carry no timestamp
(measured: every one of them has ``timestamp`` absent), so there is
nothing to compare and no rule that could be evaluated. The first sight
is therefore recorded as a baseline and the visible title is left alone;
only a title that CHANGES while we are watching moves the row. Acting on
the first sight would silently overwrite a name the user set in the
browser with one they typed days ago.

THE 64 KB TAIL IS A DELIBERATE BOUND. The real corpus on this machine
holds a 73 MB transcript, and this runs on every hook event, including
``PreToolUse``/``PostToolUse`` which fire on every single tool call.
Reading the whole file is therefore not an option that can be traded off
against accuracy - it is not an option. A rename far enough back in the
file falls outside the window and reads as
:data:`CUSTOM_TITLE_NO_RECORD`, which never changes anything. That is the
right bias: this wants NEW news, and an old rename the row has already
been living without is not news. Do not "fix" it by widening the scan to
the whole file.
