"""Session activity-status resolution - single source of truth.

Both ``TmuxBackend`` (bulk pane query) and ``SessionManager`` (owned +
attachable session listings) resolve a session's activity state through
``resolve_pane_status()`` so the rule lives in exactly one place. The states
are deliberately small and honest: we only claim what tmux's pane-level
introspection can actually tell us.

- ``dead``    - ``#{pane_dead}`` is ``"1"``. The pane's foreground process
  exited; tmux is only holding the corpse open (``remain-on-exit``). This is
  the state the user most needs surfaced loudly (see ``CLAUDE.md`` hazard
  about staring at a dead pane while health checks stayed green).
- ``running`` - pane alive AND ``#{pane_current_command}`` is something
  other than a bare login/interactive shell. In practice this is the agent
  CLI (``claude``, ``codex``, ``hermes``, ``node`` running the CLI, etc.) or
  any other foreground process the user started, since tmux only reports the
  immediate child's command name, not whether it is literally "claude".
- ``idle``    - pane alive AND the foreground command is a known bare shell
  (``zsh``, ``bash``, ``sh``, ...). The agent isn't running; the user is
  sitting at a prompt.
- ``unknown`` - the underlying tmux query failed or returned nothing we can
  parse. We do NOT guess in this case.

We do not attempt to detect "waiting for user input" from tmux alone -
tmux's pane-level introspection cannot distinguish an agent that is
thinking from one that is blocked on a prompt, so claiming that state from
a bare pane query would be fabricated, not detected. (feat/hook-driven-status
adds an HONEST way to detect it - Claude Code's own lifecycle hooks - see
``src.core.session_activity``. This module's ``resolve_pane_status()``
remains the tmux-only, hook-independent classification and is now used two
ways: as the liveness/death check every unified status still defers to
(tmux is the ONLY thing that can see a pane die), and as the graceful
fallback when a session has no hook signal at all.)

Unified activity vocabulary (feat/hook-driven-status): the four states
below are the pure tmux-introspection ones. ``src.core.session_activity``
defines three MORE states (``question``, ``working`` / ``working_subagent``,
``finished_unread``) that are driven by Claude Code's lifecycle hooks
instead of tmux, and combines all seven into one vocabulary surfaced to the
client. Both modules import their string constants from here so there is
exactly one place a display-state string is spelled - this file is the
single source of truth for every status string this app ever shows a user.

# Hook-driven states (feat/hook-driven-status) - added here, not in
# session_activity.py, so EVERY status string this app can show is defined
# in exactly one file. ``session_activity.py`` imports these; it owns no
# string literals of its own.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#: Claude is waiting on the user - a ``Notification``/``PermissionRequest``
#: hook fired and nothing has resolved it yet (a ``UserPromptSubmit``, or
#: tool activity resuming, clears it). Honest because it is driven by an
#: event Claude Code itself emits for exactly this condition - unlike the
#: old tmux-only model, this is never guessed.
STATUS_QUESTION: str = "question"

#: The agent is actively doing tool work at the top level (PreToolUse /
#: PostToolUse activity within the heartbeat window). Also the graceful-
#: degradation stand-in for the old ``running`` when a session has hooks
#: but none have fired a MORE specific signal yet, and the fallback value
#: for ``STATUS_RUNNING`` when a session has NO hook signal at all.
STATUS_WORKING: str = "working"

#: Same as STATUS_WORKING, but the activity is inside a subagent
#: (SubagentStart fired and no matching SubagentStop has landed within the
#: heartbeat window). Kept as its own state because the user explicitly
#: asked to distinguish "the agent is working" from "a subagent it spawned
#: is working" - collapsing them would lose real information hooks give us.
STATUS_WORKING_SUBAGENT: str = "working_subagent"

#: A ``Stop`` hook landed (the agent finished its turn) and the user has
#: not looked at this session since - either because no WS terminal has
#: bound to it, or because the user explicitly pinned it unread for
#: followup. This is the state the whole feature exists to surface: it is
#: the difference between "the light is green" and "there is something
#: here for you".
STATUS_FINISHED_UNREAD: str = "finished_unread"

#: All values the unified (tmux + hook) status can take. Superset of
#: ALL_STATUSES with STATUS_RUNNING dropped (it never appears in the
#: unified vocabulary - see ``session_activity.map_tmux_fallback``, which
#: maps a raw tmux "running" onto STATUS_WORKING) and the three hook-driven
#: states added.

#: Display priority, most urgent first. Not consulted by any single-state
#: resolver in this codebase (each session has exactly one computed status

    Description: Maps the two tmux pane-format values callers already query
        (``#{pane_dead}`` and ``#{pane_current_command}``) onto one of the
        four states this app reports. Pure function, no I/O - callers do the

        without a real tmux binary.

    Inputs:
        pane_dead: Raw ``#{pane_dead}`` value ("0" or "1"), or None if the
            query failed / the pane could not be found.
        pane_current_command: Raw ``#{pane_current_command}`` value (e.g.
            "zsh", "claude", "node"), or None if the query failed.

    Output:
