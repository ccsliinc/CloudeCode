"""Session activity-status resolution - single source of truth.

Both ``TmuxBackend`` (bulk pane query) and ``SessionManager`` (owned +
attachable session listings) resolve a session's activity state through
``resolve_pane_status()`` so the rule lives in exactly one place. The states
are deliberately small and honest: we only claim what tmux's pane-level
introspection can actually tell us.

- ``dead``    - ``#{pane_dead}`` is ``"1"``. The pane's foreground process
  exited; tmux is only holding the corpse open (``remain-on-exit``). This is
  the state the user most needs surfaced loudly (see ``CLAUDE.md`` hazard
  about staring at a dead pane while health checks stayed green).
- ``running`` - pane alive AND ``#{pane_current_command}`` is something
  other than a bare login/interactive shell. In practice this is the agent
  CLI (``claude``, ``codex``, ``hermes``, ``node`` running the CLI, etc.) or
  any other foreground process the user started, since tmux only reports the
  immediate child's command name, not whether it is literally "claude".
- ``idle``    - pane alive AND the foreground command is a known bare shell
  (``zsh``, ``bash``, ``sh``, ...). The agent isn't running; the user is
  sitting at a prompt.
- ``unknown`` - the underlying tmux query failed or returned nothing we can
  parse. We do NOT guess in this case.

MEASURED CAVEAT, 2026-08-28: under this app's own launch path,
``pane_current_command`` is a CONSTANT and ``running`` is unreachable.
Sessions launch through a user wrapper (``zsh -c 'cld "$@"'``), so Claude
runs as a CHILD of that shell and tmux reports only the immediate child -
``zsh`` - whatever Claude is doing. All 7 live sessions on the reference
box read ``zsh`` simultaneously, thinking and idle alike. So in practice
this vocabulary degenerates to {idle, dead} and an ``idle`` here means
"the pane's own foreground process is a shell", NOT "the agent is not
busy". Anything that needs the second meaning must read
``src.core.session_activity`` instead, which is hook-driven and can tell
them apart. This bit a rename-push gate that read raw pane status and
therefore could never refuse - see ``src/core/claude_rename.py``.

We do not attempt to detect "waiting for user input" from tmux alone -
tmux's pane-level introspection cannot distinguish an agent that is
thinking from one that is blocked on a prompt, so claiming that state from
a bare pane query would be fabricated, not detected. (feat/hook-driven-status
adds an HONEST way to detect it - Claude Code's own lifecycle hooks - see
``src.core.session_activity``. This module's ``resolve_pane_status()``
remains the tmux-only, hook-independent classification and is now used two
ways: as the liveness/death check every unified status still defers to
(tmux is the ONLY thing that can see a pane die), and as the graceful
fallback when a session has no hook signal at all.)

Unified activity vocabulary (feat/hook-driven-status): the four states
below are the pure tmux-introspection ones. ``src.core.session_activity``
defines four MORE states (``question``, ``notice``, ``working`` /
``working_subagent``, ``finished_unread``) that are driven by Claude
Code's lifecycle hooks instead of tmux, and combines all eight into one
vocabulary surfaced to the client. Both modules import their string constants from here so there is
exactly one place a display-state string is spelled - this file is the
single source of truth for every status string this app ever shows a user.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#: THE AGENT IS BLOCKED ON A YES/NO. A ``PermissionRequest`` hook fired
#: and nothing has resolved it yet (a ``UserPromptSubmit``, or tool
#: activity resuming, clears it). Honest because it is driven by an event
#: Claude Code itself emits for exactly this condition - unlike the old
#: tmux-only model, this is never guessed.
#:
#: SPLIT FROM ``STATUS_NOTICE`` 2026-09-08. Until then this one state
#: carried BOTH ``PermissionRequest`` and ``Notification``, and the two
#: are not the same claim: a permission prompt STOPS the agent until the
#: user answers, while a notification is claude asking to be looked at
#: while it carries on (or sits at an empty prompt). Collapsing them made
#: a chatty notification light identical to a turn that is actually
#: parked, which is the false-urgency twin of this project's recurring
#: false-green problem. See ``docs/session-status.md``.
STATUS_QUESTION: str = "question"

#: CLAUDE WANTS ATTENTION AND IS NOT BLOCKED. A ``Notification`` hook
#: fired and nothing has resolved it yet. Cleared by exactly the same
#: events as ``STATUS_QUESTION`` (``UserPromptSubmit``, ``PreToolUse``,
#: ``Stop``), because the thing that resolves "look at me" is the user
#: showing up, and that is what those three events measure.
#:
#: It ranks BELOW ``STATUS_QUESTION`` and ABOVE ``STATUS_WORKING``: it is
#: about the user, so it outranks work that proceeds without them, but it
#: does not stop the agent, so it must never outrank one that is stopped.
STATUS_NOTICE: str = "notice"

#: The agent is actively doing tool work at the top level (PreToolUse /
#: PostToolUse activity within the heartbeat window). Also the graceful-
#: degradation stand-in for the old ``running`` when a session has hooks
#: but none have fired a MORE specific signal yet, and the fallback value
#: for ``STATUS_RUNNING`` when a session has NO hook signal at all.
STATUS_WORKING: str = "working"

#: Same as STATUS_WORKING, but the activity is inside a subagent
#: (SubagentStart fired and no matching SubagentStop has landed within the
#: heartbeat window). Kept as its own state because the user explicitly
#: asked to distinguish "the agent is working" from "a subagent it spawned
#: is working" - collapsing them would lose real information hooks give us.
STATUS_WORKING_SUBAGENT: str = "working_subagent"

#: A ``Stop`` hook landed (the agent finished its turn) and the user has
#: not looked at this session since - either because no WS terminal has
#: bound to it, or because the user explicitly pinned it unread for
#: followup. This is the state the whole feature exists to surface: it is
#: the difference between "the light is green" and "there is something
#: here for you".
STATUS_FINISHED_UNREAD: str = "finished_unread"

#: All values the unified (tmux + hook) status can take. Superset of
#: ALL_STATUSES with STATUS_RUNNING dropped (it never appears in the
#: unified vocabulary - see ``session_activity.map_tmux_fallback``, which
#: maps a raw tmux "running" onto STATUS_UNKNOWN) and the four hook-driven

    """Project a session's resting state through its unread flag.

    Description: THE ONE PLACE ``finished_unread`` and ``idle`` are told
        apart, for every source of a status - the hook tracker, the tmux
        fallback, the durable row seed and the transcript ladder all end
        here, and so does the listing that assembles them. Pure, total
        and idempotent: applying it twice with the same flag is applying
        it once, and every state outside ``READ_STATE_PAIR`` is returned
        untouched, so a caller may run it over any status without having
        to know which ones it concerns.

        WHY IT HAD TO EXIST, MEASURED ON LIVE 2026-09-09 at 5e13cb1. The
        owner opened the daily-briefing tab and the light did not change.
        ``/sessions/list`` for ``cloude_daily-briefing`` reported
        ``unread: false`` beside ``activity_status: finished_unread``,
        ``status_source: seed_row``: the WS bind had cleared the flag
        correctly, and the durable row still held the word
        ``finished_unread`` from before the view, which the seed path
        returned verbatim. Every source had its own half of this rule and
        one of them only had the half that ADDS unread - ``idle`` plus a
        set flag became ``finished_unread``, while ``finished_unread``
        plus a cleared flag stayed exactly as it was. A one-directional
        derivation is not a derivation, it is a cache.

        THE FLAG IS THE FACT AND THE STATE IS THE VIEW OF IT. The unread
        flag is durable, keyed on the tmux instance and owned by
        ``UnreadStore``; ``finished_unread`` is a rendering of the pair
        (at rest, not yet seen). So this function never writes a flag and
        never reads one of its own - the caller supplies the flag it
        measured, and the answer is a function of that measurement alone.
        Write paths use it with ``unread=False`` to store the BASE state,
        which is why ``sessions.activity_state`` no longer bakes a read
        verdict into a column that cannot be updated when the flag moves.
    Inputs:
        state: an activity status, or None when nothing was resolved.
            Any value outside ``READ_STATE_PAIR`` is returned unchanged,
            including None - a state nobody measured is not made into a
            rest claim by a flag.
        unread: the session's persisted unread flag, as MEASURED by the
            caller. Keyword-only so no call site can pass it positionally
            and mean something else.
    Output:
        str | None: ``finished_unread`` when the session is at rest and
            unread, ``idle`` when it is at rest and read, and the input
            unchanged otherwise.
    Example:
        >>> derive_read_state(STATUS_FINISHED_UNREAD, unread=False)
        'idle'
        >>> derive_read_state(STATUS_IDLE, unread=True)
