"""Pure mappings the first-run import applies to external artifacts.

Split out of src/core/session_import.py so that file stays what it claims
to be: the one-way latch and the order of the stages it guards. Nothing
here touches the latch, and nothing here writes a row. Every function is
a total function from an artifact somebody else produced (a tmux listing
row, a session_metadata.json entry, a working directory) onto the columns
this schema stores.

THE ONE RULE THEY ALL SHARE. When an input cannot be read, these
functions return the explicit UNKNOWN, never a guess and never the value
that means "read it, and the answer was nothing". ``none`` and
``unknown`` are different claims and only one of them is a measurement.
