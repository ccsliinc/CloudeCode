"""Repository layer for the ``sessions`` table (design doc section 3.3).

Hand-rolled sqlite3, matching src/core/db.py and src/core/project_store.py
house style. No ORM.

IDENTITY, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS MODULE.

A session has two identities and they answer different questions:

  ``session_uuid``  stable EXTERNAL identity, minted by the app, never
                    reused, never recomputed. What a URL or a foreign key
                    should carry.
  the INSTANCE      ``(tmux_socket, tmux_name, tmux_created_epoch)``. What
                    a live ``tmux list-sessions`` row can be matched
                    against. Enforced by ``ux_sessions_tmux_instance``.

The tmux NAME alone is NOT an identity. Names are reusable, and this app
re-mints them itself with a ``-2``/``-3`` uniquifier
(session_manager ``_sanitize_tmux_name``). ``#{session_created}`` is what
separates "the same session" from "a different session that took the
name", and it is why every lookup in this module keys on the triple and
never on the name.

The name is also not TRUSTWORTHY input. tmux permits ``|`` inside a
session name, which is the delimiter of the listing format, so the whole
triple was once forgeable from a name a caller chose. That is fixed in
src/core/tmux_listing_parse.py, not here, but it is worth knowing that
the values arriving at these functions are only as good as that parser.

WHAT THAT BUYS. When a session dies and a new one takes its name, the new
instance's epoch differs, so it does not match the old row, so NO
statement in this module touches the old row. The new instance gets its
own row with ``origin='observed'`` and a fresh ``session_uuid``; the old
row keeps its origin and its ``adopted_at`` byte for byte and falls to
``stopped`` at the next successful probe. Without the epoch, name reuse
would silently transfer an adoption to a process the user never claimed
and badge it as his.

NOTHING EVER DELETES A SESSIONS ROW, AND THAT IS A KNOWN GAP.
Verified by walking the source rather than by grep: no statement
anywhere in ``src/`` issues ``DELETE FROM sessions``. There is no
reaper, no expiry, no repair path, and no UI affordance that removes
one. Combined with the ownership resolver's tier 2 - where ANY stored
instance for a name is a specific epoch-keyed opinion that returns
False for every other epoch - this makes a wrong ``owned`` row a
PERMANENT negative opinion about that name. A user who hits one has no
way back short of editing cloude.db by hand.

The mitigations that exist are all upstream, and they are why this is a
gap rather than an active defect: a NULL epoch is filtered out of
:func:`owned_instances` so it can never become such an opinion, and
:func:`src.core.session_import_mapping._stopped_epoch` no longer invents
a 0 that would have created one on every upgrade. So the known routes to
a wrong row are closed. What is missing is what happens if a new one
ever appears.

THE INTENDED REPAIR PATH, when it is built, is a REAPER keyed on the
instance triple: any row whose ``(socket, name, epoch)`` is absent from
a live listing, and whose ``lifecycle`` has been ``stopped`` for longer
than a retention window, may be deleted.

Its one non-negotiable precondition, stated here because it is the part
that is easy to leave out and catastrophic to miss: the reaper MUST run
only against a listing with ``ok=True``. An unavailable listing carries
no rows BY CONTRACT, not because there are none, so reaping against one
would delete the user's entire session history the first time tmux
failed to answer - turning a transient probe failure into permanent
data loss. Until that reaper exists, treat every row this module returns
as immortal.

WHERE THE WRITES LIVE. This module is the READ side. Everything that
can create, claim or refuse a row is in src/core/session_identity.py,
because those are the only operations that can get identity wrong.

THE ONE-SECOND COLLISION. ``#{session_created}`` has one-second
resolution, so a session killed and recreated with the same name inside
the same second produces a colliding triple. Two things resolve it, and
the second was added because the first covered only the rarer half:

  ``sessions.tmux_session_id`` (schema v3) stores tmux's
  ``#{session_id}``, which is unique per server lifetime. When the stored
  and incoming ids DISAGREE the rows are provably different sessions and
  the merge is refused whatever the stored lifecycle says. It is a
  DISCRIMINATOR and never a key: the id counter restarts at ``$0`` when
  the tmux server does, so it is worse than the epoch as a durable
  identity and better than it at separating two sessions alive right now.

  A stored row already marked ``stopped`` CANNOT be the live session we
  are looking at, so that merge is refused too.

In both cases the correct action is to REFUSE THE MERGE AND LOG - never
to overwrite. See :func:`record_instance` and design section 4.6.

THE LEGACY NAME SET IS A SEPARATE, LOWER TIER. It is NOT folded into
:func:`owned_instances`. It used to be, as ``(tmux_name, None)``, which
the listing backend read as a name-only WILDCARD - and that disabled the
epoch tier for every session the app had created since the last restart,
which is exactly the population the epoch protects. Legacy names now
travel as their own argument and are resolved after a stored epoch has
had its say. See :func:`src.core.tmux_listing_parse.resolve_ownership`.

ORIGIN REPLACES ``owned_tmux_sessions``. ``origin`` is a stored column
anchored on the instance triple, so it survives an app restart, a server
restart and a reboot, which the in-memory set never did. It is written
ONCE and never recomputed. Both ``created`` and ``adopted`` badge as
OURS (design 4.6, decided 2026-08-17); ``observed`` is the only value
that renders as external.

      idea of what to include, and the app read as contradicting itself.

      The rule has two halves and they are NOT the same idea:

        ENDED (``lifecycle='stopped'``) IS INCLUDED. A session whose

      IT IS A SOFT DELETE AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN, not a shortcut.

      names freely, so two rows can share a name and differ only by
      creation epoch - a name-keyed delete would take a live session
      down alongside the dead one the user actually pointed at.

      IDEMPOTENT, AND THE FIRST STAMP WINS. The ``archived_at IS NULL``
