"""Session backend abstraction.

Defines the `SessionBackend` ABC and the `build_backend()` factory used by
`SessionManager` to obtain a concrete backend instance. Two backends ship:

- `TmuxBackend` (default when tmux is available on PATH) - survives server
  restart, supports scrollback replay.
- `PTYBackend` (fallback) - thin adapter around the legacy `PTYSession`; does
  NOT survive server restart but has zero external dependencies.

Backend selection is driven by `AuthConfig.session.backend`:
- ``"auto"``  → tmux if `shutil.which('tmux')` is truthy, else pty
- ``"tmux"``  → force tmux; fall through to pty with a WARN log if tmux missing
- ``"pty"``   → force pty

The factory never raises on missing tmux - a missing binary always degrades
gracefully to PTYBackend.
