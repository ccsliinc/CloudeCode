"""The human-in-the-loop gate for claude_history ingest. See
docs/message-model-gate.md for the full design and the audit numbers this
contract was built from.

WHAT THIS IS FOR. claude_history (the owner's own tool, at
~/Development/claude-history, database at
~/Development/claude-history/data/claude_history.db) ingests millions of
JSONL lines into a relational shape (hosts, projects, sessions, messages,
compaction_events). A 2026-08-29 read-only audit of the live database
(3,004,324 messages, 19,403 sessions) found that most relationships are
essentially complete - dangling foreign keys are all zero - but several
real, load-bearing relationships are incomplete at small but nonzero
rates: 1,433 messages point at a parent uuid that does not exist on their
host, 22 subagent-spawned agent ids do not resolve to a session, 3
subagent sessions cannot find the message that spawned them, and so on.
None of that data should ever be silently dropped or silently guessed at.
This module is the STOP list: the exhaustive, data-driven set of
conditions under which an ingested item is held at a gate instead of
being linked automatically, plus the pure functions that decide what
happens to it next - never a live caller of the ingest pipeline itself.

WHY THIS IS DATA, NOT BRANCHING CODE. Same reasoning as
``hook_contract.py`` and ``alert_state_contract.py``: a condition added to
the vocabulary without a decision recorded next to it is exactly the
defect class this repo's Infrastructure CLAUDE.md calls "an unread table"
or "an assumed column value" (hazards 32/34/61 there) - a real case the
code was never asked about. Every condition is one row in
``GATE_CONDITIONS``, checkable by a totality test the way
``test_hook_contract.py`` checks the hook registry against the measured
event list.

THE THREE-OUTCOME RULE APPLIES TWICE HERE, DELIBERATELY. Once to fidelity
(``FIDELITY_VERIFIED`` / ``FIDELITY_FAILED`` / ``FIDELITY_UNVERIFIABLE``,
see below) and once to linkage (an item is either cleanly linked, held at
the gate with a NAMED reason, or - not yet a case here, but structurally
possible - linkable to more than one candidate, which is
``AMBIGUOUS_SPAWN_LINK``, not a forced pick). Collapsing "I could not
link this" into either "linked" or "corrupt" is the exact failure this
repo's hazard list is built from.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not touch the claude_history
database, its schema, or its ingest pipeline - that tool is the owner's
own, being rebuilt top-down, and this module is a design artifact for
that rebuild, not a live dependency of it. It does not define the full
message table schema (parent uuid chain, appearance-vs-identity split,
etc.) - the owner is deliberately doing that top-down, informed by the
audit this contract is built from, and doing it here would be getting
ahead of him. Every function is pure: given the same inputs, always the
same outputs, no filesystem or network access, no side effects.

#: byte-exact regeneration across 134,464 sampled lines and two known
#: serializer styles), but the state exists because the check exists.
FIDELITY_FAILED: str = "fidelity_failed"

#: The record cannot be checked at all: raw_stored is 0, there is no
#: per-line hash on file, AND the source JSONL line this record came
#: from is no longer on disk to regenerate against. This is a DISTINCT
#: state from both of the above, not a default success. Today it is
#: reachable in principle but not in practice: as of MEASURED_ON, all
#: 19,403 sessions in claude_history still have their source transcript
#: on disk (19,535 .jsonl files present) and 25/25 sampled compacted
#: sessions have identical record counts in the database and on disk, so
#: nothing is unverifiable YET. It becomes reachable the moment source
#: files are cleaned up after being trusted into the database - which is
#: why this state exists before that day arrives, not after.
