"""The ordered schema steps, and the driver that runs a range of them.

Kept apart from src/core/db_migration.py so the STEPS table stays a short,
readable list of "what each version bump does" rather than being buried
inside the startup-resolution logic that decides WHETHER to run it.

EVERY STEP MUST BE IDEMPOTENT. A step inspects sqlite_master /
PRAGMA table_info before it acts, so re-running it after an interrupted
attempt either finishes the remaining work or finds it already there and
does nothing. This is what makes a retry after an INTERRUPTED trail entry
safe by construction rather than by hoping the crash happened at a
convenient moment.

EVERY STEP MUST BE ADDITIVE. CREATE TABLE, CREATE INDEX, ALTER TABLE ADD
COLUMN. Never a drop, a rename or a retype. The whole rollback design
depends on this: forward is additive, and backward is a RESTORE from a
verified backup rather than a hand-written reversal nobody can prove is
complete.

    Description: the repair half of v9. A rename used to move the one
      field identity was keyed on, so the stored row was reaped as
      ``tmux_missing`` and the same live session returned through the
      adopt path as a stranger and got a second row.

      THE SHAPE IS RECOGNISABLE FROM THE DATA ALONE, which is what makes
      this safe to run unattended. A split pair is: same socket, same
      ``tmux_created_epoch``, same NON-NULL tmux ``#{session_id}``,
      EXACTLY two rows, EXACTLY one of them ``stopped`` and one not. Two
      genuinely different sessions cannot share both an epoch and an id
      on one socket - the id is unique per tmux server lifetime and the
      epoch pins the lifetime - so nothing legitimate has this shape.
      Every clause is a refusal: three rows, two live rows, or a NULL id
      all leave the group untouched, because none of those can be told
      apart from real data.

      THE SURVIVOR IS THE LIVE ROW. It carries the name tmux actually
      reports right now, which is the only name any probe will match.

      ORIGIN COMES FROM THE CORPSE WHEN THE CORPSE SAYS ``created``, and
      this is the one place that rule is broken on purpose. ``origin`` is
      normally written once and never recomputed - but the survivor's
      ``adopted`` is an ARTEFACT OF THE DEFECT, not a user action: the
      session was adopted only because the rename made the app treat its
      own session as a stranger. Restoring ``created`` puts back what was
      true before the bug rewrote it. The reasoning is recorded here
      rather than left implicit precisely because it contradicts the
      general rule.

      CARRY-FORWARD FILLS GAPS AND NEVER OVERRIDES. A value already on
      the survivor is a live answer and wins; the corpse only supplies

      ``session_title`` (carried on the SessionStart payload) was written
      into ``title`` - the same column v9 had just made the USER's label.
      One field, two authorities, and every consequence was silent:
      Claude's auto-generated name could become the user's displayed
      label; a user rename discarded Claude's name with no record; and the
      write had to be guarded write-once to stop the first two, which in
      turn meant a LATER Claude-side ``/rename`` could never land at all.

      NO BACKFILL, DELIBERATELY. For an existing row with a non-null
      ``title`` there is no evidence anywhere in the database saying
      whether the user typed it or Claude generated it - the write-once

      ``claude_title`` would therefore invent an attribution rather than
      recover one, and would re-create the exact confusion this step
      exists to end. ``claude_title`` starts NULL on every row and fills
      itself from the next SessionStart that carries one, which is the
      only source that can be trusted to say what Claude calls it.

      src/core/session_lineage.py checking before every write; this step
      makes SQLite refuse a second row for a uuid it already knows.

      THREE OUTCOMES, NEVER TWO, AND NEITHER COLLAPSE IS SAFE HERE.
      Checked FIRST, before any DDL runs, via
      :func:`_v12_find_claude_uuid_duplicates`:

        no duplicates    ux_sessions_claude_uuid is created and
                          ix_sessions_claude_uuid (the v7 plain index,
                          now redundant) is dropped. This is the SUCCESS
                          path - the common case, since v7's own comment
                          notes claude_session_uuid was NULL on every
                          adopted session on the owner's live machine.

        duplicates found COULD NOT EVALUATE, not a failure of THIS step
                          and not silently ignored. Neither index
                          statement runs: ix_sessions_claude_uuid (v7)
                          stays exactly as it was, so the database is not
                          left with a dangling reference to an index that
                          was dropped without its replacement existing.
                          The exact uuid/row-id groups are recorded under
                          META_SESSIONS_CLAUDE_UUID_DUPLICATES so a human
                          can see precisely what to reconcile - never a
                          silently-picked winner, per this project's own
                          standing rule against inventing a verdict
                          nobody measured.

        CREATE UNIQUE INDEX itself fails despite the pre-check finding
                          nothing (a defensive branch, not one the tests
                          below expect to hit under normal SQLite
                          behaviour) - caught narrowly as
                          ``sqlite3.Error``, recorded the same way as a
                          found duplicate, and NOT re-raised.

      NEVER RAISES. This is the one property that matters most: the
      caller (db_steps.run_chain, driven from db_migration.ensure_db_
      migrated) commits every step from the database's current version up
      to CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION as ONE transaction. An exception here
      would roll back every step before it in the same run and drop the
      whole app into DEGRADED_MIGRATION_FAILED / read-only - exactly the
      "never block boot" posture db_migration.py already holds for every
      other step, and a live database holding a duplicate uuid is a
      finding to record, not a reason to take the app down.

      DROPPING AN INDEX IS NOT THE "ADDITIVE ONLY" RULE THIS FILE'S
      MODULE DOCSTRING WARNS AGAINST. That rule protects STORED DATA -
      tables, columns, rows a restore could not reconstruct. An index is
      derived, not stored fact (REVERSAL_SQL_V7's own comment says so),
      and this step only ever drops ix_sessions_claude_uuid on the branch
      where ux_sessions_claude_uuid has just been created to replace it -
      the column stays exactly as indexable as before, only faster and
      now constrained.

      IDEMPOTENT. Both DDL statements carry IF NOT EXISTS / IF EXISTS, so
      a retry after an INTERRUPTED trail entry re-runs cleanly whichever
      branch applies; the duplicate check is a pure SELECT and costs
      nothing to repeat.
