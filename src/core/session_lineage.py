"""Claude-session identity and fork lineage inside one tmux session.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS FOR
    Before it, cloudecode tracked the TMUX session - socket, name,
    creation epoch - and knew nothing whatsoever about the Claude
    conversation running inside it. ``sessions.claude_session_uuid``,
    ``sessions.parent_session_id`` and ``sessions.fork_kind`` have been in
    the schema since v2 and were never written by anything. This module is
    the first and only writer of all three.

THE TWO IDENTITIES, AND WHY THEY CANNOT SHARE A ROW SHAPE
    A tmux session is a PROCESS that lives until it is killed. A Claude
    session is a CONVERSATION, and several of them happen in sequence
    inside one tmux session: the user starts one, forks it, clears it,
    forks it again. So the relationship is one tmux instance to many
    Claude sessions, and the table has to express that.

    ``ux_sessions_tmux_instance`` makes (tmux_socket, tmux_name,
    tmux_created_epoch) unique, so exactly ONE row can ever be keyed to a
    given tmux instance. That row is the ANCHOR. Every later Claude
    session in the same tmux session gets its own row carrying the same
    socket and name for context, ``tmux_created_epoch = NULL``, and
    ``parent_session_id`` pointing at the row it came out of.

    THE NULL EPOCH IS THE WHOLE SAFETY PROPERTY, not an omission. The
    unique index is PARTIAL on ``tmux_created_epoch IS NOT NULL``, so a
    lineage row cannot collide with the anchor. ``session_store.get_instance``
    returns None for a None epoch without querying, and
    ``session_store.owned_instances`` filters the column IS NOT NULL. So
    every existing reader of tmux identity is structurally incapable of
    mistaking a lineage row for a live tmux session - that is enforced by
    the queries themselves, not by this module remembering to be careful.

WHAT A FORK IS, AND WHY WE DO NOT HAVE TO GUESS
    Claude Code's SessionStart hook carries a ``source``. The enum was
    read out of the shipped binary (2.1.236), not taken from prose:
    ["startup", "resume", "clear", "compact", "fork"].

    startup   a new conversation. No predecessor. Not a fork.
    resume    ``--resume`` / ``--continue``. The SAME session uuid keeps
              going, so there is nothing new to reopen. Not a fork.
    fork      ``--fork-session``: the CLI minted a new uuid off an
              existing conversation. A fork, and it says so.
    clear     ``/clear``. A new uuid in the same tmux window; the old
              conversation still exists on disk and is still resumable.
    compact   the same conversation continuing past a compaction. The
              uuid does not change.

    "A resume that diverges is a fork" needs no inference from us: when a
    resume diverges the CLI itself mints a new uuid and reports
    ``source: "fork"``.

    THE DECISION IS MADE ON THE UUID TRANSITION, AND ``source`` ONLY
    NAMES THE KIND. A source string is a label that a future Claude Code
    release may add to or rename; a changed uuid is a measurement. So:

        anchor has no uuid        -> BOUND      (bind it, no fork)
        uuid already known here   -> CONTINUED  (idempotent no-op)
        uuid differs from head    -> FORKED     (new row, parent = head)

    Reading it this way makes ``compact`` correct for free - it presents
    the uuid the head already carries, so it lands on CONTINUED without
    any rule naming it - and it keeps working if a sixth source value
    appears, which would be stored as fork_kind 'unknown' rather than
    guessed at.

WHAT REOPENING NEEDS
    ``claude --resume <session-uuid>`` run in the conversation's own
    directory. Both halves are already on the row: ``claude_session_uuid``
    and ``working_dir``. No transcript path is stored - Claude resolves it
    from the cwd and the id, and a stored absolute path would be a second
    copy of a fact that can go stale.

ROWS THAT PREDATE THIS
    They carry NULL in all three columns and always will. NULL
    ``claude_session_uuid`` reads as "we never learned which Claude
    session this was", which is the truth. NULL ``parent_session_id``
    makes a row a lineage ROOT, which every pre-existing row genuinely is.
    Nothing here backfills, hides or rewrites them.

THREE OUTCOMES, NEVER TWO
    :func:`record_claude_session` can also return UNRESOLVED - the tmux
    instance has no row, the epoch was unreadable, or the datastore is
    pre-v2. That is "could not evaluate", it is reported under its own
    name, and it is never folded into either success.
