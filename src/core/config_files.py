"""
Claude-config + project file tree / editor — server-side business logic.

Three roots:

    - "user"    ``~/.claude``               (CLAUDE_HOME, reused from
                                              ``slash_command_discovery`` —
                                              single source of truth for that
                                              path rather than a second
                                              hardcoded ``Path.home()``)
    - "project" ``<working_dir>/.claude``    (the active session's config,
                                              same allow-list model as "user")
    - "workdir" ``<working_dir>``            (the active session's WORKING
                                              DIRECTORY itself — general
                                              project file browsing, added
                                              2026-08. No allow-list: any
                                              non-hidden entry is browsable.)

``project`` and ``workdir`` are both derived from the same client-supplied
``project_path`` (the session's working directory) — there is no server-side
"current project" state; the caller must have gotten this path from a real
session, never trust it as arbitrary free text.

ALLOWED_TOP_LEVEL_FILES / ALLOWED_TOP_LEVEL_DIRS / HIDE_NAMES /
HIDE_PREFIXES / SENSITIVE_NAMES / SENSITIVE_PREFIXES / SENSITIVE_SUFFIXES
below are the single source of truth for what this feature shows and how.
Every list/read/write call re-derives its answer from these constants —
nothing is duplicated in the routes layer.

Security posture (the client is assumed hostile, per the API layer):
    - every relative path is resolved with ``Path.resolve()`` and checked
      for containment inside the resolved root before any filesystem call
      touches it (blocks ``../`` traversal AND symlink escapes, since
      resolve() follows symlinks). This applies identically to all three
      roots, including "workdir" — dropping the allow-list for general
      project browsing does NOT relax the containment check.
    - "user" and "project" additionally enforce an allow-list of top-level
      names (this app's own config surface, not a general browser).
      "workdir" has no allow-list — it is a real project directory — but
      the hide-list (HIDE_NAMES / HIDE_PREFIXES) still applies, and applies
      MORE, not less: ``.git`` internals, and known-huge dependency/build
      directories (node_modules, venv, .venv, dist, build, __pycache__) are
      never listed and never resolvable by a guessed path either.
    - files matching SENSITIVE_* (``.env*``, ``.credentials.json``,
      ``id_rsa``, ``id_ed25519``, ``*.pem``, ``*.key``) are NOT refused —
      this app already grants a full remote shell, so a hard refusal here
      would be inconsistent theater, not real access control. They ARE
      flagged ``is_sensitive`` in every tree/read/write response so the
      client can mask on-screen display until the user explicitly reveals,
      and a write to one requires ``acknowledge_sensitive=True`` the same
      way an executable write requires ``acknowledge_executable=True``.
      Content is never logged for any file, sensitive or not.
    - every write is backed up first (``<name>.bak``, one generation,
      same convention as ``Settings.update_settings_config()``), and a
      ``.json`` write is parsed before it touches disk — a parse failure
      raises and nothing is written.
