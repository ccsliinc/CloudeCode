"""Running the boot re-adopt: read the rows, attach the panes, hold them.

The impure half. ``src/core/session_boot_readopt_plan.py`` decides WHICH
live sessions are ours and what each one is called; this module does the
I/O that decision implies, and nothing else. Its vocabulary
(``ID_SOURCE_*``, ``SKIP_*``, ``ReadoptTarget``) is re-exported here so a
caller has ONE import.

TWO PROPERTIES THIS PASS MUST HAVE, and both are easy to lose.

IT NEVER RUNS ON AN UNANSWERED PROBE. ``listing.ok`` is checked upstream
in ``SessionManager._lifespan_tmux_reconcile``, which stashes its listing
only past that gate, and this pass gates its OWN listing again. A listing
that did not run carries no names, and reading that as an empty socket
would disown every session on the box.

WHY IT TAKES ITS OWN LISTING RATHER THAN REUSING BOOT'S, which is the
non-obvious part and cost real time to find. ``discover_existing()`` asks
tmux for ``#{session_name}`` and NOTHING ELSE, so its rows are bare
strings with no ``#{session_created}``. An epoch is not a nice-to-have
here: with no epoch there is no instance triple, ``session_store.
get_instance`` returns None BY CONTRACT, and every single live session
would be skipped as "no row" while the pass reported a clean run.
``list_attachable_sessions`` is the listing that carries the epoch, and
paying for one extra tmux call is free on this path precisely because
the path is off the critical one.

IT IS NEVER AWAITED BY BOOT. uvicorn binds the listening socket only once
the lifespan startup coroutine reaches its ``yield``, so an awaited pass
is paid before the port answers at all. See ``schedule_boot_readopt``.

IT WRITES NOTHING DURABLE. Rows are read; registration is in memory. No
column is updated and no hook token is minted - a token minted here could
never reach the already-running agent, so it would be noise dressed as a
fix.
