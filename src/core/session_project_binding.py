"""Giving every live session a project, and never writing half an answer.

THE INVARIANT, IN THE OWNER'S WORDS: "all sessions belong to projects,
the root folder ... its impossible to not have a project." This module is
where that is enforced for a session the app can see, and it exists
because two separate defects were letting a session render with no
project on a box where the project plainly existed.

DEFECT ONE - A HALF-WRITE. ``session_identity.claim_instance`` applies
each column "only when not None", which reads as safe and is not: the
adopt path derived ``(None, 'none')`` for a directory it could not match
and handed both to the claim, so the ``None`` project id was SKIPPED and
the ``'none'`` attribution was WRITTEN. The row kept the project id it
already had and acquired an attribution that contradicts it. The client
resolves that contradiction attribution-first
(``_buildProjectSessionGroups`` in client/js/launchpad.js tests
``attribution === 'none'`` before it looks at ``project_id``), so the
session moved to "no project" while still carrying a perfectly good one.
Measured on the owner's box 2026-09-08: rows 7 and 8, ``project_id`` 1
and 2, ``project_attribution`` ``'none'``.

The rule this module adds: THE PAIR MOVES TOGETHER OR NEITHER MOVES.
A derivation that cannot beat what the row already holds writes nothing
at all.

DEFECT TWO - A SPELLING THE LEXICAL RULE CANNOT CROSS.
``project_attribution.attribute`` is deliberately, correctly lexical: it
expands ``~`` and never resolves a symlink, because resolving rewrites a
path the user chose. But ``~/Development`` on this machine is a symlink
into iCloud Drive, so a session whose probed cwd is
``/Users/jsugamele/Development/Assistants/Media`` can never match the
project declared at
``/Users/jsugamele/Library/Mobile Documents/.../Assistants/Media``. The
lexical answer ``'none'`` is locally true and globally wrong, and it is
the direct cause of defect one's contradiction.

So the ladder gets a SECOND rung: try the path as written, and only if
that matches nothing, try it canonicalised. Canonicalising is a
FALLBACK, never the primary comparison - the as-written match still wins
- so a project declared at a symlink keeps collecting the sessions
declared at that same symlink. ``transcript_import_paths.canonical`` is
the spelling function, imported rather than re-implemented, because this
codebase already decided realpath is "the one spelling this codebase
stores for a directory".

THREE OUTCOMES SURVIVE, AND THE FOURTH IS NEW.

  ``matched``            the directory as written sits under a project.
  ``matched_canonical``  it does once the symlinks are resolved. Same
                         attribution value on the row; a separate rule
                         name so a reader can tell which rung fired,
                         because a rung nobody has ever observed to fire
                         is unmeasured rather than proven.
  ``created``            it sits under nothing, so a project was minted
                         at it. Only ever with ``allow_create=True``.
  ``none``               read, and deliberately not given a project: the
                         one exclusion is a per-run scratch directory,
                         which can never be a project root.
  ``unknown``            could not be read or situated. NOT an answer,
                         and it writes nothing, ever.

WHY SCRATCH IS THE ONLY EXCLUSION. It is the same single exclusion the
transcript importer names, and it is about the PATH, not about the work:
``/private/tmp``, ``/tmp`` and ``/var/folders`` hold per-run directories
that are gone by tomorrow, and minting a project at one would put a dead
folder in the launcher forever.

MINTING IS IDEMPOTENT ACROSS BOTH SPELLINGS, which is the only reason it
is safe to run automatically. ``projects.root`` is UNIQUE and
``project_writes.create_project`` refuses a duplicate root, so a mint
that checked only one spelling would either raise or grow the second
node for one folder that the launcher fight already paid for once.
:func:`ensure_project_row` looks for an existing project at the
as-written form AND at the canonical form before it inserts anything,
and it inserts at the CANONICAL form - punchlist item 16's own note,
verbatim: "Any auto-derived path must use the resolved iCloud spelling."
