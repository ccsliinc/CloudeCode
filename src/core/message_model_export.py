"""Reconstructing a transcript's exact original bytes from the model, and
proving it.

THIS IS THE MODULE THAT MAKES THE REST OF THE MODEL HONEST. The v16
schema stores a message once and its envelope per appearance precisely so
it does NOT have to keep a second copy of every line's bytes. That trade
is only safe if the bytes can be produced again on demand and CHECKED, so
every function here returns a verdict backed by a comparison that
actually ran - never a success string the caller has to take on trust.
The sharpest failure in this fleet's hazard list is a verification step
that cannot fail; this module's :class:`ExportResult` therefore carries
the two hashes it compared, so a caller can re-check the check.

THE THREE-OUTCOME RULE, APPLIED TO EXPORT. A line either matches its
stored hash, does not match it, or could not be rendered at all (its
stored row is incomplete). Those are three distinct results with three
distinct names, and :func:`export_transcript` refuses to collapse the
third into either of the others: it raises, naming the line, rather than
returning a shorter transcript that would then fail the whole-file hash
for a reason nobody could read off the failure.
