"""Correlate an ADOPTED tmux session to the Claude conversation inside it.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES. ``sessions.claude_session_uuid`` has exactly one
writer today - ``session_lineage.record_claude_session`` - and it is
reached only from Claude Code's SessionStart hook, which fires only when
the app injected ``CLOUDECODE_SESSION_ID`` at spawn. A tmux session the
app ADOPTS instead of creates never gets that env var, so its
``claude_session_uuid`` stays NULL forever and every feature keyed on it
(fork resolution, resume, the out-of-band rename push) is dead for that
row. This module is the second writer, reached from the adopt path
(``session_adopt_persist.persist_adoption``), and it works from evidence
on disk instead of a live hook payload.

THE EVIDENCE. Claude Code writes one transcript file per conversation at
``~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<claude-session-uuid>.jsonl``, where
``<slug>`` is the working directory with every ``/`` and ``.`` replaced
by ``-`` (see :func:`slugify_project_dir`; measured against the corpus of
directory names Claude Code has actually produced on this machine,
2026-08-29). The FILENAME is the uuid - that is the fact this module
exists to recover. A subagent transcript lives one level deeper, under
``<session-uuid>/subagents/``, which is a directory, not a file, so a
plain ``iterdir()`` of the project directory already excludes every
subagent transcript by construction; nothing here has to know the
subagent shape to avoid it.

NEVER GUESS. The candidate set is every top-level transcript in that
project directory whose first real user message could plausibly have
been typed into THIS tmux pane - which means its timestamp is not
earlier than the pane's own creation time (an ``epoch_slack_seconds``
tolerance absorbs the few seconds between a pane existing and Claude's
first hook write actually landing). Exactly one such candidate is a
DECISIVE match. Zero is `no candidate ever started here`. More than one
is `more than one plausibly did`, and both of those are the SAME answer:
CANNOT DETERMINE. A tie is never broken by recency, size, or any other
heuristic - see :data:`CORRELATE_AMBIGUOUS`'s docstring for why breaking
it would be exactly the wrong kind of confident.

WHAT NEVER ENTERS THE CANDIDATE SET.

  A subagent transcript        excluded by path (see above), never read.
  An automated liveness probe  Claude Code's own healthcheck harness
                                writes a real top-level transcript with
                                ``entrypoint: "sdk-cli"`` on its first
                                user record. Measured against the corpus:
                                every "sdk-cli" transcript found was one
                                of these probes, and no genuine
                                interactive session anywhere in it
                                carried that entrypoint. Excluded outright
                                - a probe transcript is never a match
                                regardless of timing.
  An unclassifiable file       unreadable, not valid JSON on any of the
                                first ``max_lines_scanned`` lines, or
                                never reaching a top-level user record in
                                that window. Requirement: `if you cannot
                                classify a candidate, it is not a match`.
                                Excluding an unknown is the safe
                                direction here - the cost of a wrong
                                attach is high, the cost of a miss is the
                                NULL this module exists to sometimes fill.

FAIL SOFT. Every filesystem operation in :func:`correlate_adopted_session`
is wrapped so a permissions error, a missing directory, or a garbled file
degrades to ``CORRELATE_ERROR`` / ``CORRELATE_NO_CANDIDATE`` and never
raises into the adopt path. Reading the filesystem must never break an
adopt.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO. It does not write to the database - see
:func:`bind_correlated_uuid` for that half, which owns the unique-index
and archived-row safety properties separately so this module can stay a
pure, easily-fixtured reader.
