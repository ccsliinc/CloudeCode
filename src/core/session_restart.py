"""RESTARTING a stopped session: what it carries, and what it cannot be.

THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR. The launchpad's RESTART control on a stopped
session built its request from ``working_dir`` and ``agent_type`` and
nothing else. The row's TITLE was never even put into the button's
markup, and its ``session_uuid`` was in the dataset but never passed to
the handler. So restarting a session the user had named, and had been
talking to for hours, produced an unnamed blank console in the right
directory - it discarded identity the client was already holding.

A RESTART NEEDS A NEW TMUX SESSION, BUT NOT A NEW ROW. SUPERSEDED, and
the correction is the whole point of this module. ``POST
/sessions/respawn`` puts a process back into a tmux session that still
EXISTS, and it works because ``remain-on-exit`` kept the pane alive. A
session whose tmux is gone has none of that, so a new tmux session must
be spawned and its ``#{session_created}`` is necessarily a new epoch.
This module used to conclude from that that a new ROW must be inserted
too, because the identity triple ``(tmux_socket, tmux_name,
tmux_created_epoch)`` could not match the old row "and must not be made
to". That conclusion was wrong, and it did real damage.

The triple is not the session's identity - it is the identity of the
TMUX INSTANCE the session is currently running on. The session's own
identity is ``sessions.id`` and its ``session_uuid``, and those are what
every other table references: ``parent_session_id``,
``transcript_archives.root_session_id`` and
``transcript_root_decisions.root_session_id`` all point at the id, and
nothing anywhere keys off the triple except the reconciler that reads
tmux. So the triple can simply be MOVED onto the existing row - see
:func:`rebind_instance` - and every reference survives untouched.

WHAT INSERTING A SECOND ROW ACTUALLY COST. The user's title, their
conversation, their group membership, their archive roots and their
lineage all stayed on the row that had been left behind, while the
session they were now looking at was a stranger wearing a copied name.
Both rows then rendered - the live one under running sessions and the
abandoned one under recent - so every restart permanently doubled the
session list, and a "this replaced an earlier session" disclosure had to
be invented to explain a duplicate that should never have existed. The
duplicate was not a display problem. It was this INSERT.

WHY THE REPLACEMENT NOW RESUMES WITH A BARE ``--resume``. SUPERSEDED
too, and for the same reason. ``--fork-session`` was there because two
rows would otherwise have carried one ``claude_session_uuid``, which
``ux_sessions_claude_uuid`` forbids as a UNIQUE partial index. With one
row there is no second row to collide with, so the flag has nothing left
to prevent. Removing it matters beyond tidiness: a fork MINTS A NEW uuid,
so a restarted session used to stop being the conversation the user had
been having and become a copy of it. A bare resume keeps one
conversation, on one row, under one uuid. See :func:`resume_arguments`.

THERE IS NO LINEAGE STAMP ON A RESTART ANY MORE. ``parent_session_id``
and ``fork_kind`` describe one conversation coming out of ANOTHER one,
which is exactly what the explicit FORK button does and what
``session_fork`` still records. A restart produces no second session, so
there is no relationship to record - the row simply continues. Writing a
self-referential parent link would be inventing a relationship to
describe a row's own history.

THE TITLE IS CARRIED because it is never touched: it is a column on the
row being reused, and so are the pins, the unread counts and the
conversation link.

THREE OUTCOMES, AND THE MIDDLE ONE IS THE POINT. A stopped row with no
``claude_session_uuid`` has no conversation to resume - most of them,
since a session that never reached a Claude ``SessionStart`` never
learned one. The replacement is still created (the user asked for it,
and the working directory, agent and NAME are all still worth carrying)
but the caller is told plainly that no conversation was resumed. It must
never be reported the same way as a resumed one: silently starting a
blank session while implying continuity is the false green this whole
codebase is built against.

      WHY THIS IS SAFE, AND WHY IT IS SAFER THAN INSERTING. Everything
      that references a session does so by ``sessions.id``
      (``parent_session_id``, ``transcript_archives.root_session_id``,
      ``transcript_root_decisions.root_session_id``), and this UPDATE
      holds ``id`` fixed, so no foreign key is touched and nothing can be
      orphaned. Inserting a second row is what orphaned things: it left
      the conversation, the title and the archive roots on a row the user
      could no longer see. Group membership and the JSON side stores are
      keyed on ``tmux_name``, so they survive whenever the name is reused,
      which is the normal case because the old session is gone and its
      name is free.

      THE THREE COLUMNS THAT MUST MOVE TOGETHER. ``tmux_created_epoch``
      is the identity; ``tmux_session_id`` is the rename reconciler's
      discriminator (session_lifecycle._running_candidates) and a stale
      one makes it misread this row as a rename; and ``activity_state``
      is a measurement of a process that no longer exists. Leaving the
      last one behind would report a dead session as ``working`` - a
      stale value presented as a live one, which is the false green this
      codebase is built against. All three are written in one statement.

      IT REFUSES RATHER THAN OVERWRITES. If another row already holds the
      target triple, this returns :data:`REBIND_CONFLICT` and writes
      nothing; the caller records the instance the ordinary way. Forcing
      the write would hand one tmux session two rows.
