"""Notification subsystem for Cloude Code.

YAGNI scope (Item 6): started as a single push backend (ntfy.sh) wired
through a fire-and-forget asyncio dispatcher, no ABC, no plugin
registry. Slack shipped as the second backend (v0.7.0 Part 4); Pushover
is the third — exactly the "Pushover, Slack, etc." this docstring
originally anticipated. Three plain modules still don't justify the
ABC/registry refactor; revisit if a fourth shows up.

Public surface:
- ``NotificationRouter`` — synchronous ``emit()`` from any caller (PTY
  handler, IdleWatcher, lifespan hook), async worker drains a bounded
  queue and dispatches to every configured backend.
- ``NotificationEvent`` / ``EventType`` — typed payload.
- ``ntfy`` module — plain HTTP POST sender; init/shutdown/send/rotate_topic.
- ``slack`` module — incoming-webhook sender; init/shutdown/send.
- ``pushover`` module — Pushover API sender; init/shutdown/send.
- ``build_deep_link`` — helper for Click-header / url-param composition.

See ``/Users/Adam/.claude/plans/i-want-you-to-graceful-narwhal.md``
"Item 6 (notifications module) — refined" for the design contract.
