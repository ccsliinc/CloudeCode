"""The agent-family registry: one table, no if/elif chains.

feat/universal-wrappers - wrappers used to be a claude-only concept. A
wrapper now declares which COMMAND FAMILY it wraps (``AgentWrapper.family``),
and one settings screen administers every family. Adding a sixth family must
be a DATA addition to ``AGENT_FAMILIES`` below and nothing else: no new
branch anywhere, no new key in a dict literal that someone forgets to
update. Everything downstream (resolution, the settings summary, the UI
grouping, wrapper-id validation) iterates this tuple.

The old shape this replaces was a dict literal inside
``Settings.get_agent_command``::

    {"codex": agents.codex_command, "hermes": agents.hermes_command, ...}[normalized]

which had to be edited in lockstep with ``RESERVED_AGENT_TYPES``, with
``AgentsConfig``'s fields, and with the settings summary. Three places, no
compiler to catch a miss.

FALLBACK RENDERING, and why it is a per-family column rather than a branch
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
A family with no wrappers falls back to its static ``agents.<name>_command``
string, exactly as ``claude_command`` did before this change. But the two
fallbacks are NOT rendered the same way, and that difference predates this
module:

* ``claude`` wraps its command in ``zsh -c 'source ~/.zshrc ...; <cmd>'``
  because a claude launch commonly names a shell FUNCTION (``cld``) that
  only exists once ``~/.zshrc`` has been sourced, and tmux's spawned pane
  shell is non-interactive.
* ``codex`` / ``hermes`` / ``openclaw`` source the rc for the SAME
  reason claude does: they name a binary the user installed themselves,
  and a version manager (nvm, asdf, mise) puts its shims on PATH from an
  rc file. The tmux pane shell reads no rc, so a bare ``codex`` is
  "command not found".
* ``shell`` returns its command RAW. ``shell_command`` is ``$SHELL -i``,
  an INTERACTIVE shell, which sources the rc itself; wrapping it would
  source the rc twice and hard-code zsh as the launcher for the one
  family whose entire point is honouring ``$SHELL``.

CORRECTED 2026-08-26, and the original reasoning is worth keeping because
it is the trap. This section used to say the other four returned their
command raw "because that is what they did before this change and a
behaviour change there would be a regression, not a generalization."
Preserving prior behaviour preserved a defect. The tell was already in
the tree: ``make_tool_last_resort`` wraps its script in ``rc_prefixed``
unconditionally, so the two paths disagreed, and they disagreed in the
worse direction -

    codex_command = ""       -> last resort  -> rc-sourced   -> WORKS
    codex_command = "codex"  -> static path  -> raw          -> BROKEN

``AgentsConfig.codex_command`` defaults to ``"codex"``, so configuring
NOTHING worked and shipping the default did not. When two paths to the
same launch disagree about the environment they need, one of them is
wrong; do not assume it is the newer one.

So ``sources_zshrc`` is a column in the table, not a conditional in the
resolver.

Every family has a LAST-RESORT rendering, used when it has neither
wrappers nor a non-empty static command. That is one more column
(``last_resort``), still data. ``claude``'s is the historical
``cld``/``cldor`` hardcoded fallback; the other four are built by
``src/core/agent_last_resort.py``. The column used to be ``None`` for the
other four, which meant ``render_static_command`` returned the EMPTY
STRING and the launch silently produced a pane that exited at once. Read
that module's docstring before changing any of this: a ``None`` here is
not a neutral default, it is an empty command.

RESERVED NAMES, and the agent_type disambiguation this module encodes
--------------------------------------------------------------------
``Session.agent_type`` stores EITHER a wrapper id (``"cld"``) OR a bare
family name (``"shell"``). ``resolve_agent_type`` is the single place that
disambiguates the two, and the ORDER is load-bearing for backward
compatibility. See its docstring.

``RESERVED_FAMILY_NAMES`` is deliberately NOT every family name: it excludes
``claude``. A config seeded by the v0->v1 migration can contain a wrapper
whose id is literally ``"claude"`` (``build_seed_wrappers`` authors one), and
that wrapper must stay reachable by id. Reserving the name would have made
``agent_type="claude"`` resolve to the family default instead of to that
specific wrapper, silently changing which script runs on a machine whose
default wrapper is something else. See ``resolve_agent_type``.

         reserved names were already checked first, and wrapper ids matching
         them are refused at creation time (``Settings.add_wrapper``).
         The family's own wrappers are then consulted by the caller, which

         literally ``"claude"`` (the v0->v1 migration authors one) rather
         than to the claude family's default wrapper, which could be a
         different script entirely.
