"""Corpus-wide transcript ingester built on top of transcript_archive.py.

WHY THIS EXISTS. transcript_archive.py (schema v14) is the proven storage
layer: byte-exact ingest, export, verify, and a rooting primitive that
never guesses. This module is the layer ABOVE it - the thing that walks a
real ``~/.claude/projects`` corpus (via transcript_corpus_discover.py),
decides what is new versus already stored, ingests everything (never
gates storage on classification - see below), and then applies only the
DECISIVE rooting rules this project's STANDING HAZARDS forbid inventing
heuristics for.

STORE FIRST, CLASSIFY SECOND. The owner's goal is "confirm all my history
is preserved... i can consider it 100 percent backed up." A file being an
automated liveness probe, an orphaned subagent transcript, or a session
this database has never heard of are all CLASSIFICATION questions - they
decide how something is later DISPLAYED, never whether it is STORED. This
module ingests every readable ``*.jsonl`` under the corpus root,
including the probes (entrypoint ``sdk-cli``, see
claude_transcript_correlate.PROBE_ENTRYPOINT) and every subagent
transcript. Nothing here ever skips a file for what it appears to be.

IDEMPOTENCY KEY, STATED EXPLICITLY (this was the task's own instruction -
"this is the most important design decision").

CORRECTED 2026-09-02, AND THE ORIGINAL ORDERING IS LEFT DESCRIBED BELOW
RATHER THAN QUIETLY REWRITTEN, because the wrong version plus its
correction is more useful than a clean lie. The key used to be the pair
``(source_path, content_sha256)`` evaluated PATH FIRST, and the ordering
was the defect: the hash was only ever compared when the path lookup HIT.
Bytes this database already held, arriving under a path it had never
seen, produced ``existing = None`` and were stored AGAIN in full. When
``~/Development`` became a symlink every corpus slug changed at once and
that re-stored 19,294 files / 3.78 GB, silently. See
src/core/transcript_content_dedupe.py for the incident, for why
``Path.resolve()`` would NOT have prevented it, and for the mechanism.

THE KEY NOW HAS THREE STEPS, and the third is the one that cannot be
fooled by a rename:

  0. ``content_sha256`` GLOBALLY (:func:`~src.core.transcript_content_dedupe.find_archive_by_content`).
     If ANY row in the database already holds these exact bytes, the
     file is recorded as a metadata-only row pointing at that row - a
     real archive for its own source_path, storing no second copy of the
     content. This is checked whenever the path lookup did not already
     settle the question, so a corpus that moved costs metadata, never
     gigabytes.

The two path-scoped steps still run first, unchanged, because they are
cheaper and answer the common case (an unchanged file, and a growing
one):

  1. ``source_path`` (corpus-relative, e.g. ``<slug>/<uuid>.jsonl`` or
     ``<slug>/<uuid>/subagents/agent-x.jsonl`` - never an absolute path,
     because an absolute path is host-specific and this identity must
     mean the same thing on any machine that mounts the same corpus)
     names WHICH file. Corpus-relative rather than absolute so the same
     logical transcript ingested from two different checkouts of the
     corpus (e.g. two rsync copies) is recognised as the same file.
  2. ``content_sha256`` of the CURRENT bytes on disk names WHAT STATE
     that file is in right now.

A re-run against unchanged content is a no-op: the newest
``transcript_archives`` row for that ``source_path`` already carries that
exact ``content_sha256``, so nothing is written - this is what makes
re-running the ingester safe after an interruption.

THE GROWING-FILE CASE, THE NORMAL CASE, NOT AN EDGE CASE. A live Claude
Code session's transcript file grows continuously while the conversation
is in progress - every run of this ingester against a live corpus will
find some fraction of files whose content_sha256 no longer matches the
last-ingested row for that source_path. When that happens this module
does NOT overwrite or delete the old row - transcript_archives has no
UPDATE path for content_gzip anywhere in this codebase, on purpose, since
overwriting a byte-exact archive would silently discard whatever the
previous ingest had captured (an earlier snapshot of an in-progress
conversation is still real history: if this process were ever
interrupted or lost mid-conversation, the earlier snapshot is the only
copy of what existed at that point). Instead a NEW transcript_archives
row is inserted, ``kind`` and ``source_path`` identical, content and
content_sha256 different, root_state starting again at 'unrooted'. The
rooting pass in this module re-resolves it independently. The
consequence, stated plainly: a session ingested three times while live
produces three transcript_archives rows for the same source_path, and
that is correct - it is the append-only philosophy this database already
uses for transcript_root_decisions, applied to the growing-file case. A
caller that wants "the current state of this transcript" queries for
MAX(id) among rows sharing a source_path, which is exactly the query this
module's own idempotency check performs internally
(:func:`_latest_archive_for_source`).

ROOTING, DECISIVE ONLY - see the module docstring in transcript_archive.py
for the stop-case this must never violate. Two rules, both structural,
neither a guess:

  (a) SUBAGENT -> PARENT, BY DIRECTORY STRUCTURE. A subagent transcript's
      ``source_path`` is always ``<slug>/<uuid>/subagents/<file>.jsonl``
      - the ``<uuid>`` directory component IS the parent session's own
      filename stem. :func:`_derive_parent_source_path` recovers
      ``<slug>/<uuid>.jsonl`` by pure path arithmetic (no content is
      read, no heuristic is applied); if a session-kind archive with
      that exact source_path exists, the subagent archive is rooted to
      it via ``parent_archive_id``. If the parent was never ingested
      (missing, unreadable, or genuinely does not exist in the corpus),
      the subagent stays unrooted - reported as
      ``subagent_unrooted_no_parent``, never guessed at.
  (b) SESSION -> sessions ROW, BY EXACT UUID MATCH. A top-level
      transcript's filename IS the Claude session uuid (schema v13's
      ``claude_session_uuid`` capture is what makes this decisive - see
      claude_session_correlate_ladder.py). transcript_archives already
      extracts this into its own ``claude_session_uuid`` column at
      ingest time (see transcript_archive.py's ``_write_archive_rows``).
      This module looks up ``sessions.claude_session_uuid`` for an EXACT
      match: zero rows leaves it unrooted
      (``session_unrooted_no_session_row`` - most of the corpus, since
      most historical transcripts predate this app's own session
      tracking), exactly one rows it, more than one is refused and left
      unrooted (``session_unrooted_ambiguous`` - sessions.
      claude_session_uuid is UNIQUE in the schema, so this should be
      structurally impossible; it is handled anyway rather than assumed
      away, per the three-outcome rule).

THE OTHER DIRECTION: sessions WITH NO TRANSCRIPT. See
:func:`sessions_without_transcript` - a pure read, never mutates
anything, answers the owner's explicit second question ("anything in
original database that we dont have jsonl transcripts for") as a
three-way report, not a single count: sessions that name a
claude_session_uuid this ingest never saw a matching filename for (a
real gap), and sessions that have never learned a claude_session_uuid at
all (a DIFFERENT, weaker finding - there is no transcript filename to
even look for, so "no transcript" cannot be distinguished from "we never
learned which transcript is ours").
