"""Session manager for Claude Code instances.

Multi-concurrent-session design: holds any number of live `SessionBackend`
instances, keyed by ``session_id`` - two browser tabs can each attach to a
different session and neither disconnects the other. Per-session state
(backend, output subscribers, log buffer, command count, idle watcher, adopt
FIFO offset) lives in dicts keyed by ``session_id``; global state
(``owned_tmux_sessions``, ``pinned_themes``, the notification router) stays
scalar. Backend type (tmux vs PTY) is selected per-session via
``build_backend(settings)`` which reads ``AuthConfig.session.backend``.

Back-compat shim: ``self.session`` / ``self.backend`` are read-only
properties resolving to ``current_session()`` / ``current_backend`` (the
most-recently-created session) so the handful of legacy single-session
callers in ``src/api`` keep working unchanged.

        Prepends to the per-session list (newest-first). Resolves the

        so the client can paint a session-colored left border without an
        extra theme lookup on the wire. Caller is responsible for the
        WS broadcast (the route layer does this after calling this method
        - keeps storage and fanout decoupled).

        SUPERSESSION. When the session already holds an UNACKED toast of a
        superseding kind with the same title (``Stop``, and only ``Stop``),
        this REPLACES that record in place and returns it instead of
        appending a second one. The id is deliberately preserved:

          - The client dedupes by id and a coalesced card acks EVERY member
            id on dismiss. A fresh id per turn would leave the browser
            holding ids the server no longer has (their acks land on
            nothing) while the server holds an id the browser never saw,
            which comes straight back on the next attach backfill.
          - The caller broadcasts the returned Toast either way, so the
            client sees one id for one card and the count it renders
            matches the number of records the server actually holds. A
            card reading "x12" over a single stored record is the same
            class of lie as twelve cards over twelve records, just
            pointing the other way.

        The returned Toast is therefore not always newly created. Callers
        must not assume ``toast.id`` is unseen.

        v0.7.0 Part 4 - also emits a ``NotificationEvent`` into the
        attached router (if any) so ntfy + Slack channels fan out from

        which passes ``--resume <uuid> --fork-session`` so the new tmux
        session resumes an existing conversation and branches it. The args
        travel THROUGH the user's own wrapper, not around it, because the
        wrapper is where their auth is set up.

        Multiple sessions coexist - this does NOT raise if other sessions
        are live (the old single-active invariant is gone). A zombie
        session matching this exact ``session_id`` (stale metadata, dead
        backend) is cleaned up first.

        ``initial_cols`` / ``initial_rows`` are forwarded to the backend's
        ``start()`` so the pane is birthed at the client's measured size.
        Both must be supplied together or both omitted; backends fall back
        to their own defaults otherwise. The WS resize handshake reshapes
        later regardless - these are strictly a birth-time optimization.

        ``project_name`` (optional) is the human-readable project label from
        the launchpad. When supplied and non-empty after sanitization, the
        resulting tmux session is named ``cloude_<sanitized name>`` verbatim
        instead of falling back to the legacy ``cloude_ses_<hex>`` derivation
        keyed off ``session_id``. An empty/whitespace-only value (or one that
        sanitizes to empty) silently falls back to legacy naming - this is
        by design so the launchpad can always send the field without special-
        casing blanks. PTYBackend ignores the override entirely.

        ``model`` (provider-selector modal, v3.1) - only meaningful when
        the resolved agent_type is ``"claude"``. None launches Claude
        directly via the ``cld`` zsh function; set launches it OpenRouter-
        routed via ``cldor <model>`` (see ``Settings.get_agent_command``).
        Ignored (harmlessly) for every other agent_type. Persisted on the
        resulting ``Session`` alongside ``agent_type`` regardless of
        ``auto_start_claude``, so it survives for the life of the session
        even on a manual/no-autostart create.

        ``terminal_command_id`` (feat/settings-tabs-and-commands) - id of
        a configured entry in config.json's ``terminal_commands``. When it
        resolves, the stored command text is TYPED into the new pane after
        the shell starts, via the existing ``SessionBackend.write()``
        (tmux ``send-keys``) - the same path a keystroke from the user's
        browser takes. It is never exec'd by this process and never passed
        to a shell by us, which is why an id (not a command string) is
        what crosses the API boundary; see
        ``src/core/terminal_commands.py``. An unknown id is ignored and

        On-disk metadata is unlinked when the detached session was the

        set - a name collision against either is a conflict.

        On success the following state is updated atomically (from the
        caller's perspective; we hold no async lock since SessionManager
        is single-threaded under the asyncio event loop):

          * ``TmuxBackend.tmux_session`` -> new_name (via ``backend.rename_session``)

          * ``owned_tmux_sessions`` re-keyed (drop old, add new) for owned
            sessions. Adopted sessions keep their ``adopted:<old_name>`` id
            but the in-memory ``Session.tmux_session`` carries the new name.
          * ``pinned_themes`` map re-keyed (drop old, add new) so a v0.6.x
            downgrade still finds the pin under the new name. v0.7.0 themes
            live in ``<working_dir>/.cc.theme`` keyed by cwd, so the
            authoritative project theme is unaffected by the rename.
          * ``session_metadata.json`` re-persisted so a restart rehydrate
            sees the new name.

        Args:
            session_id: Session id (NOT tmux name). Returns ValueError if
                unknown / not running.

                charset). We re-validate against the live tmux landscape
                here for uniqueness.

            Instantiates a throwaway probe TmuxBackend (same pattern as
            ``list_attachable_sessions``) and calls
            ``list_pane_status_all()``, which is ONE ``tmux list-panes -a``
            subprocess call covering every session on the socket. Callers
            key into the result by tmux session name (NOT our internal
            ``session_id``) since that's what both owned backends
            (``backend.tmux_session``) and attachable rows (``row["name"]``)
            carry in common.

            Non-tmux deployments (PTYBackend / no tmux on PATH) get an empty
            map - every lookup then falls back to ``STATUS_UNKNOWN``, which
            is honest: we have no pane-level introspection for a PTY child.

        Inputs: none (reads live tmux state via the probe backend).

          and nothing about tmux; cloudecode knows the tmux instance and
          nothing about the conversation. The bridge is
          ``CLOUDECODE_SESSION_ID`` - injected into the spawned agent's
          environment at ``new-session`` time by
          :meth:`get_env_for_spawn`, echoed back by the hook as the
          ``X-Cloudecode-Session`` header, and resolved HERE to a tmux
          name and then, via a live listing, to the instance triple that
          keys the row. No new channel and no new credential: the
          existing hook trio already proves both identity and locality.

          THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE THE TWO CAN BE JOINED. The hook cannot
          learn the tmux creation epoch (it is not in the pane's
          environment), and the server cannot learn the conversation uuid
          any other way, so the join has to happen server-side against a
          fresh listing - the same shape ``persist_adoption`` uses, for
          the same reason.

          IT NEVER RAISES. Every failure is a named outcome. The caller is
          the hook endpoint, which runs inside a live working session's
          critical path; an exception escaping here would become a 500,
          and while the hook one-liner discards that, a telemetry write
          has no business producing one.

          ``SessionEnd`` is accepted and deliberately writes nothing to
          lineage. It is a real event worth logging, but the row already
          says which conversation was there, and marking it ended would

          adopted session was permanently external and the claim did not
          survive so much as a page reload. It is now a stored column on
          a row keyed by the tmux INSTANCE triple, so it survives an app
          restart, a server restart and a reboot.

          THE DECISION: an adopted session is OURS, for good. ``created``
          and ``adopted`` both badge as ours because
          ``session_store.owned_instances`` selects
          ``SESSION_OWNED_ORIGINS``, which holds both. ``observed`` is the
          only external value. Which of the two it was stays in the
          column and is shown on the session detail surface.

          Takes a FRESH listing rather than trusting the client's, so an
          instance that died between the client's list and its click is
          caught here and reported as gone instead of being claimed.

          not there.

          by the time this runs the session is live and usable, and

        Multi-session: this NEVER detaches another session and NEVER
        raises 409. ``confirm_detach`` is accepted for API back-compat
        and IGNORED - multiple adopted/owned sessions coexist. If a
        session with this exact id (``adopted:<name>``) is already
        registered (re-adopt by another tab), its old backend is wiped
        first before the fresh attach.

        Ordered sequence (fixes the scrollback/WS race):
          1. Build a ``TmuxBackend.for_external(name, ...)`` instance.
          2. ``attach_existing(needs_pipe_setup=True)`` - starts pipe-pane
             BEFORE any scrollback capture so the FIFO is warm.
          3. Record ``fifo_start_offset = os.path.getsize(pipe_path)``
             right after pipe-pane is active - the WS tailer seeks here
             so the client doesn't see bytes already painted via scrollback.
          3b. Resize the pane to the attaching client's dimensions, when
             it supplied them. An external session is born 80x24 and this
             app never attaches a tmux client, so nothing else will ever
             reshape it - measured 2026-08-17, an adopted session sat at
             80x24 next to an app-created 163x46 one on the same socket.
             This runs BEFORE the capture so the captured bytes are
             emitted at the width the client will render them at, which
             is the same ordering the rejoin path already uses.
          4. Capture scrollback via ``backend.capture_scrollback()``.
          5. Register the session/backend (keyed ``adopted:<name>``) and
             stash the FIFO offset for the WS handler to consume.

        The adopted session is NOT added to ``owned_tmux_sessions`` - it
        isn't ours, we're borrowing it.

        Args:
            name: literal tmux session name on our socket.
            confirm_detach: accepted for API back-compat, ignored.
            initial_cols: client-measured grid width, or None.
            initial_rows: client-measured grid height, or None. Both must
                be supplied for the pre-capture resize to run; one alone
                is not enough to describe a grid and is ignored.

        Returns:
            dict with ``session``, ``initial_scrollback_b64``, and
            ``fifo_start_offset`` keys (route wraps in AdoptSessionResponse).

        Description: the server half of the launcher's restart control.
            ``remain-on-exit`` means a session whose agent exited still
            exists - window, pane, pane id, scrollback and the app's
            ``pipe-pane`` all intact - so this puts a process back into
            that pane rather than building anything new.

            IDENTITY IS PRESERVED BY CONSTRUCTION, NOT BY COPYING FIELDS.
            The durable identity of a session row is the instance triple
            ``(tmux_socket, tmux_name, tmux_created_epoch)``, and
            ``#{session_created}`` belongs to the SESSION, not to the
            pane's process - a respawn does not change it. So every
            existing lookup keeps matching the SAME row and its
            ``session_uuid``, ``origin``, ``project_id``, ``pinned_theme``,
            unread state and title are untouched because nothing writes
            them. This method issues NO database write at all.

            THAT IS ALSO WHAT SEPARATES IT FROM A FORK. A fork deliberately
            mints a new row and sets ``parent_session_id`` / ``fork_kind``.
            A respawn cannot mint one, because there is no new instance for
            a row to key on, and it never touches either column.

            AN ALREADY-BOUND BACKEND IS REUSED, not rebuilt. When the user
            has the session open in the app there is a live ``TmuxBackend``
            with a running tail loop; respawning through it means the
            existing ``pipe-pane`` (which survives the respawn - measured)
            keeps streaming and the open terminal simply comes back to
            life. Building a second backend for the same pane would leave
            two readers on one file.

        Inputs:
            name: literal tmux session name as shown in the session list.
            socket_name: tmux socket override. Internal/test use only -
                the HTTP route never passes it, so a client cannot aim
                this at another socket. Defaults to the configured one.

        Output:
            dict: ``{"name", "kind", "ok", "detail", "command"}``.
                ``ok`` False with a ``kind`` of ``cannot_determine`` is a
