"""The shared transcript keyset page, and the ``session_ref_scheme`` filter.

WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE. :mod:`src.core.archive_hierarchy` was at 499
lines against this repo's 500-line cap, so the ``session_ref_scheme``
filter could not be added there without pushing it over. The seam chosen
is not arbitrary: everything here is about ONE PAGE OF TRANSCRIPT ROWS -
the column list, the row shape, the keyset predicate and the one filter
that narrows it - while ``archive_hierarchy`` keeps the entity listings
that USE that page. Both the project listing and the corpus-unattributed
listing call :func:`transcript_page`, so the two cannot drift apart about
what a transcript row looks like or how it is ordered.

THE SCHEME FILTER IS A POST-FILTER INSIDE AN ALREADY-INDEXED RANGE, which
is the same shape as the ``role`` / ``record_type`` / ``model`` filters on
``/lines`` and is implemented to match them deliberately rather than as a
second, parallel mechanism. Measured 2026-08-31 on the live 21,039-row
corpus: with the scheme predicate present the plan is still
``SEARCH t USING INDEX ix_message_transcripts_project (project_id=?)``,
so the filter costs nothing beyond the rows the scope already visits, and
one page of project 12 filtered to ``uuid`` took 0.0012s.

AN UNKNOWN SCHEME VALUE IS A ``cannot_determine``, NOT AN EMPTY ``ok``.
"there is no scheme called ``convo`` in this archive" and "no transcript
in this project carries that scheme" are different findings, and only the
second is an empty success. :func:`resolve_session_ref_scheme` therefore
returns a resolved/unresolved flag rather than a value the caller can
mistake for None-means-no-filter. It resolves against the DATA - a
``LIMIT 1`` existence probe over ``message_transcripts`` - for the same
reason ``/lines`` resolves against ``message_roles`` rather than a
hardcoded list: a constant in this file is a guess that ages into a lie
the day the ingest learns a third scheme. Measured cost: 0.0000s for a
value that exists (the probe stops at the first row) and 0.0037s warm for
one that does not, which is the only case that must scan.

WHAT THE FILTER ACTUALLY FILTERS ON, STATED SO THE UI CANNOT OVERCLAIM.
It filters on the ``session_ref_scheme`` COLUMN and on nothing else. That
column is NOT a guarantee of conversation-ness: measured 2026-08-31, 19 of
the 1,451 ``uuid``-scheme transcripts carry a ``session_ref`` that is not
a UUID at all - literal values like ``audit`` and ``journal``. Every
response says so in ``meta.filters.session_ref_scheme_means`` so a client
rendering a "Conversations only" button has the caveat in hand and does
not have to remember it.
