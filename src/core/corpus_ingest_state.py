"""On-disk state for the app's corpus ingester: scan cache and liveness.

TWO ARTIFACTS, TWO PURPOSES, DELIBERATELY SEPARATE FILES.

1. THE SCAN CACHE is a pure PERFORMANCE artifact and is allowed to be
   wrong in exactly one direction. It records, per corpus-relative
   source_path, the ``(size, mtime_ns, content_sha256)`` last observed.
   The ingester uses it to skip re-hashing a file whose size AND mtime
   are both unchanged AND whose cached hash still matches what the
   database holds for that path. Deleting it costs one slow run and
   nothing else; a corrupt or unreadable one is treated as absent. It is
   NOT in the database on purpose: it is a cache, it carries no history,
   and putting it in cloude.db would mean a schema migration to add a
   table whose entire content can be recomputed from the filesystem.

   WHY THE DATABASE HASH IS PART OF THE SKIP CONDITION. An mtime+size
   match alone would say "this file has not changed since we looked",
   which is not the question. The question is "is what is on disk
   already IN the archive". If the cache says the file is unchanged but
   the newest archive row for that path carries a different hash (a
   half-finished run, a restored database, a deleted row), the file is
   re-hashed and re-ingested rather than skipped. The cache can therefore
   only ever cause extra work, never a missed file.

2. THE LIVENESS ARTIFACT is the ingester's own dead-man's switch, and
   its AGE is the signal, not the absence of errors. An ingester that
   died looks exactly like one that keeps finding nothing new: both
   produce no output and no alert. So every run - including a run that
   ingested nothing, and including a run that FAILED - stamps
   ``latest.json`` with a UTC timestamp, and the status surface reports
   the age of that stamp. A missing artifact is NEVER "fine, nothing to
   report"; it is ``never_ran``, a named third outcome.

THE THREE-OUTCOME RULE APPLIES TO FRESHNESS ITSELF.
:func:`classify_freshness` returns one of four states and never
collapses them: ``current``, ``stale``, ``never_ran`` (no artifact on
disk at all) and ``cannot_determine`` (an artifact exists but its
timestamp cannot be parsed, or the clock produced a negative age). A
freshness verdict of ``current`` is only ever returned when an age was
actually measured.
