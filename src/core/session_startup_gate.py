"""Is this session blocked on an unanswered STARTUP prompt?

A freshly launched claude that is parked on its folder-trust dialog is a
live pane, running a real claude process, with a pid tmux will happily
report - and it has fired NO lifecycle hook at all. Every signal the
status machine reads therefore says "fine", so the row painted a green
Connected dot while the session sat there waiting for a keypress nobody
on a phone could see. That is punchlist item 19.

THE SIGNAL IS THE ABSENCE OF A HOOK, AND IT WAS MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED.
Controlled experiment on the owner's box, 2026-09-08, claude 2.1.263, on
a throwaway ``tmux -L cloude-test`` socket with the hook POSTs pointed at
a local listener:

  - Launched in an UNTRUSTED directory: pane born at epoch 1788880316,
    alive, ``#{pane_dead}=0``. At +15s the trust dialog was on screen and
    the listener had received ZERO POSTs. The dialog was answered at
    +34s; the FIRST hook of the session, ``SessionStart``, landed 1.76s
    later, at +35.8s.
  - Launched in the SAME directory once trusted, three consecutive runs:
    ``SessionStart`` landed 0.49s, 0.50s and 0.41s after pane birth.

So a hook for this instance is positive proof startup finished, and
roughly half a second is the normal cost of getting one.

WHY A SEPARATE FIELD AND NOT A SIXTH ``activity_status``. The activity
vocabulary in ``session_status.py`` describes what the AGENT is doing
once it is running. This describes whether it has started running at
all, which is a different question with a different evidence base (no
hook has EVER fired here, so the activity machine is by definition in
its tmux-fallback path). Folding them would make every existing consumer
of ``activity_status`` handle a state it has no vocabulary for.

THE THREE OUTCOMES, AND WHAT EACH ONE CLAIMS.

  ``ready``                    measured NO. Either a hook has fired for
                               this instance, or the pane's process is
                               gone, or the scrollback was READ and
                               carries no startup prompt. Note the exact
                               claim: "not blocked on a startup prompt".
                               It is NOT a claim that the session is
                               healthy - a dead pane answers ``ready``
                               here because a corpse is certainly not
                               waiting for a keypress, and
                               ``activity_status`` is the field that says
                               it is dead.
  ``awaiting_startup_prompt``  measured YES. A live pane, past the grace
                               window, no hook for this instance, and a
                               startup prompt POSITIVELY MATCHED in the
                               scrollback tail.
  ``unknown``                  could not determine. Pane liveness did not
                               answer, the instance could not be dated,
                               the grace window has not elapsed, or the
                               tail could not be captured. Not having
                               looked is never evidence of absence.

A HOOK OUTRANKS THE SCROLLBACK, ALWAYS, AND THAT ORDER IS THE POINT. The
trust dialog does not clear itself off the pane's history when it is
answered: ``capture-pane`` keeps showing it for as long as it is in
scrollback. So a session that answered the prompt an hour ago still has
the marker text sitting in its tail. Reading the tail first would pin
that session at ``awaiting_startup_prompt`` forever. Old scrollback is
STALE EVIDENCE, and the hook is the fresh fact that supersedes it.
``resolve_startup_gate`` therefore tests the hook before it ever looks at
the text, and ``tests/test_session_startup_gate.py`` pins that ordering.

THIS MODULE IS PURE. The per-instance bookkeeping (``StartupGateLedger``)
and the one tmux read (``capture_pane_tail``) live next door in
``src/core/session_startup_gate_ledger.py``, so the ladder above can be
tested without a tmux server and without mutable state.

#: 0.41-0.50s after pane birth (three runs, 2026-09-08, claude 2.1.263,

STARTUP_HOOK_GRACE_SECONDS: int = 20

#: How much scrollback to read when the cheap gates say the tail is worth

#: How long a pane-tail reading stands before the gate pays for another

#:
#: WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. ``should_capture_tail`` was written on the
#: claim that its refusals make the capture free in steady state, because
#: "a session that has fired a hook can never be awaiting a startup
#: prompt" and "a healthy session fires one within half a second of
#: birth". Both sentences are true and the conclusion still does not
#: hold, because the hook record is IN-MEMORY and per server process: an
#: idle session that fired its last hook before this process started has
#: no record and will never acquire one, so it is alive, long past the
#: grace window, and hookless on every poll for as long as it lives.
#: MEASURED 2026-09-09 on the owner's box: 13 of 13 live sessions took a
#: capture on every listing poll, 349 ms of the 1008 ms that pass spent
#: in tmux subprocesses, forever, on a box with nothing wrong with it.
#:
#: 30s AGAINST A 5s LISTING POLL is a six-fold cut, and it costs nothing
#: in detection latency for the case the gate was built for. Only a
#: RE-look is throttled: an instance with no reading on record is read
#: immediately, so a freshly launched session parked on its folder-trust
#: dialog is still caught on the first poll past the grace window. What
#: the interval bounds is how long a session that becomes stuck LATER -
#: the user quits claude and starts it again by hand inside a pane whose
#: ``#{pane_pid}`` does not move, so nothing invalidates the record - can
#: sit unnoticed. Half a minute to notice a state that needs a human
#: anyway is the right trade for six-sevenths of the cost.

#: renders it, captured 2026-09-08 from the probe described in the module
#: docstring. NOTE WHAT CHANGED SINCE THE FINGERPRINT TABLE WAS WRITTEN:
#: ``src/core/agent_fingerprint.py`` still carries
#: ``^\s*❯\s*1\.\s*Yes, I trust this folder``, and 2.1.263 does NOT number
#: the options and does NOT put the cursor on the "yes" row - the live
#: capture reads "❯ No, exit" first and "  Yes, I trust this folder"
#: second. That pattern cannot fire on a current claude. It is left alone
#: here (it still matches older versions, and this module does not own
#: that table) but it is why these markers are matched loosely on the
#: sentence text rather than on the option chrome.
#:
#: The last one is the OAuth device-login screen, the other startup state
#: that blocks on a keypress. Its URL shape comes from the 2026-08-18
#: live-capture audit recorded in ``agent_fingerprint.py``; it has NOT

    """Is reading this pane's scrollback worth a subprocess call?

    Description: the COST GATE, and the reason this feature is free in
        steady state. Capturing a tail is one ``tmux capture-pane`` per
        session per listing poll, which would be an unacceptable tax on
        the home screen if it ran for every row. It does not need to: a
        session that has fired a hook can never be awaiting a startup
        prompt (see the module docstring on evidence ordering), and a
        healthy session fires one within half a second of birth. So the
        capture runs only for a pane that is alive, past the grace
        window, and has produced NO hook.

        THAT SET IS NOT EMPTY ON A WORKING BOX, and the claim that it is
        was this project's most expensive wrong sentence. The hook record
        lives in ``StartupGateLedger``, which is IN-MEMORY and per server
        process, so a session that fired its last hook before this
        process started has none and never will. Measured 2026-09-09: 13
        of 13 live sessions, every one of them healthy, took a capture on
        EVERY listing poll - 349 ms of a 1008 ms pass, run synchronously
        on the event loop, which is what turned a listing cost into
        keystroke lag in the terminal.

        The fourth refusal is what closes it: a reading that is still
        fresh stands rather than being re-taken. A ``tail_age_seconds``
        of None means nothing is on record for this instance, which reads
        as "look now" - so the FIRST look is never delayed and the case
        the gate exists for (a session parked on its folder-trust dialog
        since birth) is detected exactly as promptly as before.

        Deliberately a separate predicate from ``resolve_startup_gate``
        rather than an early return inside it: the resolver must stay
        pure so it can be tested without tmux, and the caller must be
        able to decide whether to pay for the tail BEFORE it has one.

        pane_alive: True/False/None from the caller's liveness read.

          4. The instance could not be dated, or is younger than the
