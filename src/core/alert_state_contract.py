"""The alert / hierarchy status-light contract. See docs/alert-state-model.md.

DESIGN ONLY. Nothing here has a caller yet. This module exists so the
design in ``docs/alert-state-model.md`` is checkable data rather than only
prose - the same relationship ``hook_contract.py`` has to the hook event
list.

THE CENTRAL IDEA, stated once here because it is the thing every function
below exists to serve: a status light is a function of TWO INDEPENDENT
INPUTS, never one collapsed value.

    color     = f(own_state)          -- what THIS node itself is doing
    animation = f(descendant_axis)    -- whether ANYTHING beneath it,
                                          at any depth, is currently working

The two axes never override one another. An idle session with a working
descendant is ``(idle, breathing)``. A working session with a working
descendant is ``(working, breathing)`` - same animation, different color,
both facts visible at once. This replaces an earlier draft of this module
that computed a single "roll-up" state by picking a winner between a
node's own state and its descendants'; that design was corrected by the
owner specifically because picking a winner destroys one of the two
facts. See ``docs/alert-state-model.md`` section 3 for the full account,
including why ``STATUS_WORKING_SUBAGENT`` (a real, shipped seventh value
of the OWN axis in ``session_status.py``) is deliberately NOT reused
here - under this model that concept is the ``breathing`` animation
layered on any color, not a color of its own. That is an explicit,
recorded disagreement with the shipped code, not a silent redefinition.

WHY THE TABLE IS DATA, NOT A FUNCTION BODY. Every row today happens to
follow two simple invariants (color always equals own_state; animation
depends only on descendant_axis). It is still stored as an explicit,
fully enumerated table rather than computed from those two invariants at
call time, because the owner has said more states are coming, and the
day one of them needs an EXCEPTION to either invariant, that exception
is a single row's ``animation`` (or, in principle, ``color``) column
changed - a data edit anyone can review as a diff - never a rewrite of
branching logic buried in a function. ``status_light`` performs exactly
one dict lookup and contains no state-name comparisons at all.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It does not read a filesystem, a
database, tmux, or a live hook stream. It does not know how to enumerate
a node's actual descendants - that data source is an open gap (see the
design doc, section 6, item 1). Every function here is pure: given the
same inputs, always the same outputs, no side effects.

#: ``docs/session-status-model.md``. Its own-axis vocabulary is that
#: document's ``ALL_ACTIVITY_STATUSES`` MINUS ``working_subagent`` - see
#: the module docstring for why that one value is deliberately excluded.
NODE_KIND_SESSION: str = "session"

#: A level >= 1 descendant - a subagent, a subagent's subagent, and so
#: on. ``spawnDepth`` (real data, read from a subagent's ``.meta.json`` -
#: see the design doc section 0) says how deep; every depth shares this
#: SAME own-axis vocabulary and the SAME table, by the explicit decision
#: in the design doc section 2.1 not to define a separate vocabulary per
#: depth.
NODE_KIND_CHILD: str = "child"

ALL_NODE_KINDS: Tuple[str, ...] = (NODE_KIND_SESSION, NODE_KIND_CHILD)

#: The session's own-axis vocabulary: everything ``session_status.py``
#: defines EXCEPT ``STATUS_WORKING_SUBAGENT`` (see module docstring).

#: A child's own-axis vocabulary. Named ``idle`` rather than ``stopped``
#: on purpose - ``stopped`` already means something different and durable
#: on the LIFECYCLE axis (a tmux instance that is GONE). See design doc
#: section 2.2, "Naming note". Deliberately narrower than
#: ``SESSION_OWN_STATES``: no ``question`` (unverified whether a subagent
#: can independently block on the user - design doc gap 2) and no
#: ``finished_unread`` (no per-child unread flag exists - design doc gap
#: 3). Reuses the exact same three string constants as

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#: At least one descendant, at any depth, currently has own_state ==
#: STATUS_WORKING. The owner's own words: "working background will
#: always make it breathe" - absolute, no own_state carve-out. See the
#: (dead, working) row below, which is the one row where this absolute
#: rule is doing real work: it is kept ON specifically because that
#: combination should not be possible in steady state, so seeing it
#: breathe is a deliberate cleanup signal, not an oversight (design doc
#: section 3.5).
ANIMATION_BREATHING: str = "breathing"

#: No descendant is working. Produced by BOTH ``descendant_axis ==
#: STATUS_IDLE`` (every descendant that exists is definitely idle, or
#: there are none at all) AND ``descendant_axis == STATUS_UNKNOWN`` (at
#: least one descendant's state could not be evaluated, and none is
#: definitely working). Those are two DIFFERENT rows of ``LIGHT_TABLE``
#: that happen to share this one animation value - see the module
#: docstring's "why the table is data" note and design doc section 3.3.
#: An ``unknown`` descendant must not manufacture a breath it cannot
#: justify (a vanished subagent that keeps its ancestor breathing forever
#: is a stuck light nobody would trust - the owner's own words: "the
#: safety is against a STUCK CLAIM, not against telling the truth"), but
#: it is never rewritten to ``idle`` in the underlying data -
#: ``LightRow.descendant_axis`` on that row still reads the literal
#: string ``"unknown"``, inspectable by any caller that looks past the
#: animation.

#: descendant_axis value -> the animation it produces, on EVERY row today
#: (see the module docstring - this is a current invariant of the table,
#: not a rule the lookup function enforces). Used only to BUILD
#: ``LIGHT_TABLE`` below, literally, one row at a time - never consulted
#: by ``status_light`` itself, which does a table lookup and nothing else.
#: Two descendant_axis values map to the same animation (STATUS_UNKNOWN
#: and STATUS_IDLE both -> ANIMATION_STEADY) - deliberate, see
#: ANIMATION_STEADY's docstring above.

#: The one (node_kind, own_state, descendant_axis) key that is a
#: DELIBERATE CONTRADICTION rather than a normal cell: a session
#: confirmed ``dead`` by tmux (a terminal, authoritative fact - a process
#: exit, not a guess) with a descendant confirmed ``working`` (a real,
#: currently-heartbeating subagent, not merely ``unknown``). Physically
#: should not happen in steady state - a subagent is a subprocess of the
#: pane's own process - so the owner's instruction was to KEEP it
#: breathing rather than suppress it: seeing it IS the signal that
#: something did not clean up (design doc section 3.5). No rule
#: elsewhere in this module forces a dead/terminal own_state to render
#: quiet; this constant exists only to mark which single row gets the
