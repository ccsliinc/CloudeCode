"""The result type for every tmux enumeration in this app.

WHY THIS TYPE EXISTS. ``tmux list-sessions`` answers a question by
printing lines. It also fails to answer that question in at least four
ways, and every one of them exits non-zero with nothing on stdout. Code
that models the answer as ``List[str]`` has exactly one value available
to express all five outcomes, and it picks the empty list - so "tmux is
not installed", "the probe timed out", "tmux exited 2 with a socket
permission error" and "there are genuinely no sessions" all render as a
healthy machine with zero sessions.

That is the false-green class this repo's THREE-OUTCOME RULE exists to
kill: pass, fail, and COULD NOT EVALUATE, where the third is never a
flavour of the other two. An empty list is an ANSWER. A failed probe is
the ABSENCE of an answer. They need different values, so they get
different fields.

THE SHAPE.

    ok        True  -> the probe RAN and ``sessions`` is the complete,
                      trustworthy answer. ``sessions == []`` with
                      ``ok=True`` means genuinely zero sessions.
              False -> the probe did not produce an answer. ``sessions``
                      is always ``[]`` and carries NO information.
                      Callers MUST NOT transition, prune, or reconcile
                      any state against it.
    sessions  The rows. Element type is the producer's business:
              ``discover_existing`` yields ``str`` names,
              ``list_attachable_sessions`` and ``list_pane_status_all``
              yield ``dict`` rows.
    reason    A short machine-readable token, present on BOTH outcomes.
              On ``ok=True`` it explains why the answer is what it is
              (``no_server`` = tmux told us there is no server, which is
              a real, complete answer of zero). On ``ok=False`` it names
              what stopped us. ``None`` means "listed normally".
    detail    Optional human string (trimmed stderr, exception text) for
              the log line and the UI tooltip. Never parsed.

WHY ``no_server`` IS ``ok=True``. This is the whole crux of the type. A
tmux server exits when its last session ends, so "no server running" is
the NORMAL steady state of a machine with zero sessions - it is tmux
answering the question, not failing to. Collapsing it into ``ok=False``
would make the home screen shout CANNOT DETERMINE at every user who has
simply closed all their sessions, the alert would lose its credibility
within a day, and the type would be worthless. Collapsing the other way
- treating every rc=1 as ``no_server`` - is the original bug. The split
is made by :func:`classify_listing_failure` on the stderr text, and it
is the single place that decision is made.

DELIBERATELY NOT A COLLECTION. This class defines no ``__iter__``, no
``__len__`` and no ``__bool__``. That is on purpose: a call site that
was not updated fails loudly with a ``TypeError`` instead of silently
iterating, or silently testing truthy, and reintroducing the exact bug
this type was written to remove.
