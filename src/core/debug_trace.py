"""A loud, opt-in trace for the paths that fail silently.

WHY THIS EXISTS, STATED AS THE INCIDENT THAT CAUSED IT. Claude's
SessionStart hook delivered nothing for every session on a real install.
The hook was registered, it ran, it exited 0, the endpoint was reachable,
the environment was correct, and ``claude_session_uuid`` was never
written. Finding it took an hour of bisecting a shell one-liner by hand,
because EVERY layer reported success and none of them recorded what it
actually saw. The one variable that mattered - a trailing ``&`` that
orphaned curl before it delivered - was invisible from every log in the
system.

WHAT THIS IS FOR, AND WHAT IT IS NOT. It is for the paths where a failure
looks exactly like a success: a hook that fires and delivers nothing, a
spawn whose environment is subtly stale, a lookup that returns an empty
list because it read the wrong attribute. Those are not exceptional paths
and they raise nothing, so ordinary error logging never sees them. This
is not a replacement for ``logger.info`` on real events.

DESIGN, AND THE REASONS.

  OFF BY DEFAULT, ONE SWITCH. ``CLOUDE_DEBUG=1``. Not a log level: a level
  is a blunt global that also unmutes every per-second poller, which is
  what made the production log unreadable and is why the filtering bound
  logger was added in the first place. This is a separate axis so it can
  be verbose about six interesting call sites without touching the rest.

  ITS OWN FILE, NEVER THE APP'S STDOUT. Under launchd the app's stdout is
  launchd.log, which is rotated by newsyslog and whose fd the process
  holds across rotation - so a burst of debug output there is both
  unbounded and, after a rotation, invisible. This writes to
  ``<state_dir>/debug/trace.jsonl``, which nothing else touches and which
  can be deleted at any time.

  IT MUST NEVER BECOME THE FAULT. Every entry point swallows its own
  errors. A tracer that can break the thing it is tracing is worse than
  no tracer, and this one runs inside request handlers and a subprocess
  spawn path.

  SECRETS ARE REDACTED BY KEY NAME, and the redaction is deliberately
  aggressive: this file exists to be pasted into a conversation while
  debugging, so a token in it is a token in a transcript. Anything whose
  key contains token/secret/key/password/authorization is replaced with a
  LENGTH and a fingerprint, which is what you actually need to answer "is
  it the same one?" without ever printing it.
