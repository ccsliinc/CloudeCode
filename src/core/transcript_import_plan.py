"""Decide what ONE transcript should become: a session row, or nothing.

THE OWNER'S MODEL, VERBATIM (2026-09-08): "all sessions belong to
projects, the root folder. sessions and projects can be archived not
deleted. archived items are not visible unless the checkbox is checked."
And: "i dont need any test bs but everything real should be accounted
for."

So the default is IMPORT. This module's job is not to find reasons to
skip; it is to decide which project a real conversation belongs to and
what its row should say. There is exactly ONE EXCLUSION RULE - the
scratch paths - and everything else below it is a statement that the
file is not a session at all rather than a policy about one. All three
are NAMED outcomes, never silent drops:

  EXCLUDED  the conversation ran in a scratch directory this app or an
            agent harness created for itself - ``/private/tmp/``,
            ``/tmp/``, ``/var/folders/``. Not a judgement about whether
            the work mattered; those paths are per-run temporary
            directories that no longer exist and can never be a project
            root, so a row pointing at one could never be resumed.
  ABSENT    the file holds no conversation at all. That is measured by
            transcript_import_facts, not decided here.
  NOT A     the file is not a top-level conversation. Measured on the
  SESSION   live corpus 2026-09-08: 364 of 1,167 files carrying a cwd are
            named ``agent-<id>.jsonl`` - a SUBAGENT's run inside somebody
            else's conversation - and 123 distinct parent ids cover 436
            of them. They are components of a session, not sessions.

THE IDENTITY OF A TRANSCRIPT IS ITS FILE STEM, NOT ITS RECORDED
``sessionId``, and getting that backwards is what surfaced the case
above. ``claude --resume <id>`` opens ``<id>.jsonl`` in the project
directory, so the stem is the only id a restart can act on. A subagent
file's records carry the PARENT conversation's ``sessionId``, so keying
on the recorded value would have proposed 364 rows all claiming to be
conversations they are not, most of them colliding on a uuid a parent row
already holds. The stem is classified by
``message_model_serialize.session_ref_scheme`` - the corpus's existing
single spelling of "uuid / agent / opaque" - rather than by a second
pattern invented here.

THE OWNER'S OWN TEST PROJECTS ARE REAL AND ARE IMPORTED. ``fstest``,
``scrolltest``, ``permtest`` under a real home directory, a
``Scratch/llmScratch`` lab - he did that work, in a directory he chose,
and "this looks like a throwaway" is exactly the judgement that would
start quietly deleting his history.

EXISTENCE ON DISK IS NOT THE RULE. A cwd that no longer exists still
imports, under a created archived project. The rule is whether the PATH
is real - a place on this machine the owner worked - not whether the
directory survived. Deleting a folder does not un-have the conversation,
and a rule keyed on ``os.path.isdir`` would silently drop every finished
project. There is a test for exactly this, as a NEGATIVE CONTROL.

PROJECT RESOLUTION, IN TWO STEPS.

  1. MATCH. The existing project whose ``root`` CONTAINS the cwd, deepest
     first. Both sides are canonicalised with ``realpath`` before
     comparing, because ``~/Development`` is a symlink into iCloud on
     this machine and the same directory is spelled two ways - the defect
     that already manufactured two junk project rows. Deepest wins
     because that is what ``derived_deepest`` already means everywhere
     else in this schema; a shallower root containing a deeper one is not
     a tie.
  2. CREATE, ARCHIVED. No match means a project row is created for the
     cwd's ROOT FOLDER, with ``archived_at`` set. The rule for "root
     folder" is: the git top level the cwd sits inside, else the cwd
     itself. Git is asked by walking up for a ``.git`` entry, stopping at
     ``$HOME`` - no subprocess, so the answer is deterministic and a test
     can build one. It matters: 17 transcripts ran in
     ``.../claude_4/frontend`` and belong with the 37 in ``claude_4``.
