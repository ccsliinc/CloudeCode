"""Short descriptions for the common-slash-command row.

WHY SHORT: the row renders as a grid of tappable chips. On a phone a chip
is roughly half the viewport wide, so a description only helps if it fits
on one line next to a command name that is already 6-10 characters. A
sentence wraps to three lines, the grid grows past the fold, and the row
stops being the quick-access affordance it exists to be. Every entry here
is capped at ``MAX_DESCRIPTION_LENGTH`` and that cap is enforced by test,
not by good intentions.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY: ``common_slash_commands`` in config.json has
always been a list of bare strings::

    "common_slash_commands": ["/clear", "/compact"]

That form still works and always will - ``normalize()`` fills the
description in from the table below. A user who wants their own wording
(or who added a command this table has never heard of) can write the
object form instead, mixed freely with plain strings::

    "common_slash_commands": [
      "/clear",
      {"command": "/deploy", "description": "ship it"}
    ]

The two forms are interchangeable per entry, so no existing config needs
touching and no migration runs.
