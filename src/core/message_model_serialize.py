"""Splitting a transcript line into identity + envelope, and putting it
back together byte-for-byte.

THE ONE THING THIS MODULE MUST NEVER GET WRONG. Nothing else in the
message model matters if a stored record cannot be turned back into the
exact bytes it arrived as. Every function here is pure and every claim it
makes is checkable against a sha256 of the original line - there is no
path where a record is called reconstructed without that comparison
actually running (see ``src/core/message_model_export.py``).

WHY A LINE CAN BE REBUILT AT ALL. Claude Code writes each JSONL line with
one serializer, and a 2026-08-11 audit found 100.0000% of 134,464 sampled
lines regenerate byte-exact from their parsed JSON using one of two
styles. Re-measured here on 2026-08-29 against 20,000 raw lines drawn
from the live claude_history database: 20,000 of 20,000 reproduced with
``compact`` and zero needed anything else. So the model stores a style
MARKER plus a hash, not a second copy of the bytes.

WHY THE STYLE LIST HAS FOUR ENTRIES AND NOT TWO. The two measured styles
differ in separators. ``ensure_ascii`` is a second, independent axis that
the separator measurement did not isolate: Python's ``json.dumps``
escapes non-ASCII by default and JavaScript's ``JSON.stringify`` does
not, so a corpus containing any non-ASCII character would fail to
reproduce under the wrong setting for a reason that has nothing to do
with separators. Enumerating both axes costs four cheap string
comparisons at ingest and removes a whole class of "it reproduced for
ASCII files and not for the others" from ever happening.

THE THIRD OUTCOME IS BUILT IN. :func:`detect_style` returns None when no
style reproduces the line, and that is a NAMED result the caller must
handle (by storing the raw line and raising the fidelity gate condition),
not an exception to swallow and not a default style to guess at.
