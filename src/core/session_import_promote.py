"""Promote-only writes for the re-runnable session-attribution import.

Stage D of ``docs/session-attribution-import.md``. The original import
latch was one-way, which is why nine sessions imported with no evidence
stayed EXTERNAL permanently. Making it re-runnable is easy and making it
SAFE is the whole job, because a naive re-run would undo two things the
user cannot get back:

  1. a row we have already PROVED is ours, which a later run with worse
     evidence would downgrade;
  2. a "leave it as external" answer the user gave, which a later run
     would ask again on every boot until he stopped reading prompts.

So every write in this module moves in exactly one direction and is
gated in SQL, not in Python. The gate is part of the UPDATE's WHERE
clause, so a caller that forgets to check cannot cause the write:

    origin = 'observed' AND user_declined_at IS NULL

PROMOTE, NEVER DEMOTE. There is deliberately no function here that writes
``origin='observed'`` over anything. Downgrading is not a capability this
module withholds by convention - it is one it does not implement.
