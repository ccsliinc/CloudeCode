"""Run one title-sync pass for a session, and write at most one row.

The seam between the pure reader in :mod:`src.core.claude_title_sync` and
the database. It exists as its own module for the reason the respawn
ladder keeps ``session_transcript_presence`` separate: the rules stay
testable without a datastore, and ``session_manager.py`` - already well
past the 500-line guideline - does not grow another method.

WHAT THIS RUNS ON. Every Claude Code hook event, including ``PreToolUse``
and ``PostToolUse``, which fire on every single tool call. So the cost of
the common path is the design constraint, not an afterthought:

  * one SELECT of five columns on an indexed-ish lookup,
  * one ``os.path.getsize``,
  * one read of at most 64 KB,
  * and NO write at all unless a name actually changed.

The transcript path is resolved once per conversation and cached in
process, because :func:`conversation_presence` falls back to scanning the
corpus root's subdirectories and there are 89 of them on this machine.
Doing that per tool call is exactly the kind of "small" cost that turns
into a stalled event loop, which this codebase has already paid for once
with ``PRAGMA integrity_check`` on the version endpoint.

IDEMPOTENCE IS NOT OPTIONAL HERE. Hook events are unordered, duplicated
and droppable, so a pass must survive the same event twice and a missing
one. It does, because the decision is a comparison against
``sessions.claude_title`` rather than a transition: running it twice
compares the second time against what the first time wrote and stops.
