"""What a restart WOULD do, answered without doing it.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES. Until now ``POST /sessions/respawn`` was the only
entry into the respawn ladder and it MUTATES, so there was no way to ask
which rung a session would land on before committing to it. That made an
honest warning impossible, and the warning is the part that matters:
an empty ``#{pane_start_command}`` lands on ``RESPAWN_SHELL``, which
hands back a LOGIN SHELL. A picker that lets someone confidently choose
``claude-chrome`` and then drops them at a zsh prompt is worse than no
picker at all.

SO THE PREVIEW RUNS THE SAME FUNCTION THE ACTION RUNS. Every outcome
below comes out of ``resolve_respawn_plan`` in
``src/core/session_respawn.py``, called with the same probe values the
respawn would use. It is not a second model of the ladder and it cannot
drift from one, because there is only one ladder. What this module adds
is the SHAPE: run it once with no override to get "what a plain restart
does", then once per configured wrapper to get "what picking this one
does", and hand the caller both.

A LIVE SESSION GETS AN ANSWER TOO, AND THAT NEEDED A SECOND ENTRY POINT.
``resolve_respawn_plan`` stops at ``RESPAWN_NOT_DEAD`` before it ever
reads ``#{pane_start_command}``, so on its own it can only tell you a
running session is running - not what it would come back AS. That is
useless for exactly the sessions anyone wants to restart: on this machine
18 are live and most have been idle for days, and the ones carrying a
NULL ``agent_type`` are precisely the ones that would return a bare login
shell.

So every plan here is produced TWICE, from the same single probe:

  ``unchanged`` / ``kind``
        what a restart would do RIGHT NOW. On a live pane, ``not_dead``
        and not actionable. This is the safety answer, and a button must
        obey it.
  ``projected`` / ``projected_kind``
        the rung it WOULD land on, liveness ignored
        (``project_restart_rung``). Never ``not_dead``. This is a
        PREDICTION, NEVER A PERMISSION - it exists so the UI can say
        "this would come back as a plain shell" about a session that is
        still running, which is the warning the whole feature is for.

``pane_state`` carries the liveness fact on its own ('dead' / 'alive' /
'unknown') so the two can never be read as one.

ONE ROUND TRIP, ON PURPOSE. The alternative - re-asking the server every
time the highlighted wrapper changes - would put a network hop inside a
radio-button click and would let the panel show a stale verdict next to
a fresh selection. The pane is probed once and every option is derived
from that single reading, so the options on screen are all answers about
the same observed state.

THE THIRD OUTCOME APPEARS TWICE HERE, and neither instance may be
flattened into a zero:

  ``wrappers_status``  'ok' means the wrapper list was read and
                       ``options`` reflects it; an EMPTY options list
                       then genuinely means this install configures no
                       wrappers. 'unavailable' means the list could not
                       be read, and a client that draws that as "no
                       wrappers to pick" is stating something nobody
                       measured.
  each option's ``kind``
                       carries ``cannot_determine`` on its own terms.
                       An option whose command could not be resolved is
                       reported unavailable WITH its reason, never
                       silently dropped from the list - a choice that
                       vanishes looks like a choice that never existed.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It performs no I/O of any kind: the caller probes
tmux, reads the row and resolves the wrapper commands, and this
classifies. Same division of labour as the ladder itself, and the same
reason - it makes every outcome testable without a tmux binary.
