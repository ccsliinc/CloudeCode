# interpolates the model into a ``zsh -c '...'`` command string handed to
# tmux (double shlex-quoted there as defense-in-depth - see
# ``render_wrapper_invocation`` in ``src/core/agent_wrappers.py`` and
# ``get_agent_command`` in ``src/core/agent_families.py``, both of which
# wrap the model in ``shlex.quote`` before it reaches a shell), but this
# regex is the primary gate - anything outside this shape is rejected
# before it ever reaches a shell. Keep in sync with the TODO.md contract
# regex if one is added there.
#
# The ``(?!-)`` negative lookahead blocks a leading ``-``: without it, a
# model id like ``--continue`` or ``-p`` would pass the charset check, sail
# past ``cldor``'s own ``[[ "$1" != -* ]]`` guard (which just skips
# consuming it as the model and forwards it into ``"$@"``), and land as an
# injected flag on ``claude --dangerously-skip-permissions``.
#
# ``:`` is allowed for real OpenRouter model-variant ids
# (``vendor/model:free``, ``:nitro``, ``:online``, ``:extended``,
# ``:beta``), but only in one specific shape: exactly one colon, never
# leading, never trailing, with at least one allowed character on both
# sides. That is expressed as two required, non-colon "segments" joined by
# an optional single ``:segment`` - not by adding ``:`` to the flat
# charset - so a leading colon, a trailing colon, and a doubled colon are
# all structurally unreachable rather than merely undesired. ``(?!.*\.\.)``
# additionally refuses any ``..`` substring (defence against path
# traversal if a future call site ever builds a filesystem path from this
# value; no such call site exists today - grepped and confirmed at time of
# writing - but the id shape should not depend on that staying true), and
