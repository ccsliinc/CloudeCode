        ``codex`` / ``hermes`` / ``openclaw`` / ``shell`` are RESERVED -
        always their fixed single command, unaffected by anything below.

        Everything else (``"claude"``, ``None``/empty, or a custom string)
        is the "claude family" and resolves in this order:
          1. ``agent_type`` matches the ``id`` of a configured wrapper
             (``agents.wrappers``) - launch through THAT wrapper
             specifically (see ``src/core/agent_wrappers.py``). This is
             how a caller picks a non-default wrapper explicitly - the
             wrapper's own id doubles as its agent_type value. The
             resolved ``Session.agent_type`` ends up being that wrapper
             id, so which wrapper launched a session is recorded the same
             way agent_type always has been - no second field.
          2. ``agent_type`` is exactly ``"claude"``, ``None``/empty, or
             any string that ISN'T a configured wrapper id (unknown type
             → safe fallback to the claude family, unchanged from
             pre-wrappers behavior) - AND at least one wrapper is
             configured: use the DEFAULT wrapper
             (``agent_wrappers.default_wrapper``).
          3. No wrappers configured at all (the common case for every
             config.json written before this feature - wrappers defaults
             to ``[]``): ``agents.claude_command`` if explicitly set to a
             non-empty string, run verbatim through the same
             ``~/.zshrc``-sourcing wrapper.
          4. Neither wrappers nor claude_command configured: the
             ORIGINAL hardcoded ``cld`` / ``cldor <model>`` zsh-function
             fallback, byte-for-byte unchanged from every prior release.
        Steps 3-4 are UNREACHABLE the moment any wrapper exists in config
        (step 2 always finds at least the default wrapper first) - this is
        intentional: a wrapper list is a strictly additive, opt-in
        superset of the old two-step fallback, never a partial mix of the
        two for the same launch.
        ``CLAUDE_CLI_PATH`` remains LEGACY / a no-op for this type - see its
        field comment on ``Settings.claude_cli_path``.

        Why the ``~/.zshrc``-sourcing wrapper (steps 3-4, and internally
        inside wrapper resolution too): tmux's spawned pane shell does NOT
        source ``~/.zshrc`` (non-interactive, non-login - see
        TmuxBackend.start / tmux's own ``$SHELL -c <command>``
        invocation), so a bare ``cld`` would be "command not found".
        Empirically verified (real detached tmux session on a scratch
        ``-L`` socket, ``tmux capture-pane``) against two candidate
        wrappers; ``zsh -c 'source ~/.zshrc >/dev/null 2>&1 </dev/null; <cmd>'`` was
        chosen over ``zsh -ic`` - see git history for the full comparison
        this docstring used to carry.
        The model, when present, is shlex-quoted at every quoting
        boundary it crosses so it can never break out of or be
        reinterpreted by any layer (verified against ``; rm -rf /``,
        backticks, ``$(...)``, and a leading ``~``).
        ``CreateSessionRequest.model`` / the provider-add endpoint already
        restrict model ids to ``^[A-Za-z0-9._~/-]{1,120}$`` before this is
        ever called - this quoting is defense-in-depth, not the only guard.

        Returned shape: a single shell string, which the tmux backend
        hands directly to ``new-session ... <cmd>`` (tmux itself execs it
        via the pane's default shell, ``-c <string>`` - one level of shell
        parsing on our returned string, hence the quoting above).

CLOUDE CODE - CONFIGURATION ERROR
========================================

Failed to load configuration from .env file.

Error: {str(e)}

This usually means:
1. Required fields are missing from .env (DEFAULT_WORKING_DIR, LOG_DIRECTORY)
2. Required auth fields are empty (TOTP_SECRET, JWT_SECRET)
3. .env file is malformed or has invalid values

To fix:
1. Run setup_auth.py to regenerate .env with all required fields
2. Or manually edit .env and ensure all required fields are present

Required fields:
- DEFAULT_WORKING_DIR (path to projects directory)
- LOG_DIRECTORY (path to logs directory)
- TOTP_SECRET (generated by setup_auth.py)
- JWT_SECRET (generated by setup_auth.py)
