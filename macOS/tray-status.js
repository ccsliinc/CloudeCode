// tray-status.js - decide what the menu-bar icon should look like.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
//
// The tray icon is the only part of this app visible without clicking
// anything, so it is the only place a problem can announce itself. Until now
// it was a single fixed glyph: identical whether the server was healthy, dead,
// or unreachable. The user asked for three signals in it - server state,
// sessions needing attention, and an available update.
//
// THE THREE-OUTCOME RULE IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS MODULE.
//
// An icon that looks healthy when the app could not reach the server is
// exactly the false green this project has spent its time eliminating. So
// "could not determine" is a first-class state here with its OWN appearance
// (a hollow ring, never a filled dot, never the plain healthy glyph). A
// filled dot means "I measured this and it is true". A hollow ring means "I
// could not measure this". Absence of a dot means "I measured this and there
// is nothing to report". Those are three different claims and they get three
// different pictures.
//
// A NOTE ON WHICH SIGNAL DRIVES THE ICON
//
// Only ONE unknown escalates the icon to the unknown state: an
// undeterminable SESSION list. That is deliberate, and it is not a collapse
// of the third outcome. The icon answers one question - "does something need
// your attention right now" - and the session list is the input to that
// question. The update check is a different question, it routinely cannot
// reach GitHub on an offline laptop, and letting it pin the icon to "unknown"
// forever would turn the icon into furniture: a warning that never clears is
// not a monitor.
//
// Nothing is silently dropped, though. describeSignals() below reports every
// signal's own three-state verdict separately, and the caller renders all of
// them into the tooltip and the menu. The icon prioritises; the text tells
// the whole truth.
