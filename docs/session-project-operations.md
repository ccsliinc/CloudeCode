# Session and project OPERATIONS, derived from the code

Scope: what each operation actually does to a session row, a project row and
the tmux session underneath. The STATUS model - how a session's activity light
is computed - is a separate document and is not covered here.

Derived by reading `src/`, `client/js/` and `macOS/` at branch
`fix/ended-sessions-visibility`. Verified 2026-08-26.

## How to read the citations, and the drift test that enforces them

Every node and edge below carries the file and symbol it was derived from, in
one of exactly two machine-checkable forms:

| Form | Means | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `path/to/file.py::symbol` | that file defines that top-level or method symbol | `src/core/session_label.py::set_label` |
| `METHOD /route` | a router in `src/api/` declares that route | `POST /sessions/adopt` |

`tests/test_docs_operations_chart_drift.py` parses THIS FILE, extracts every
citation of both forms, and asserts each one resolves in the code. Rename a
symbol or a route and the chart fails the suite instead of quietly becoming
fiction. The test is deliberately dumb - it proves the chart's vocabulary is
real, it cannot prove the arrows are right.

Anything marked **NOT IMPLEMENTED** is specification, not code. It is drawn
because the decision has been made, and it is fenced off so nobody reads it as
a description of the shipped build.

## 1. Object identity

Everything else depends on this. Five different identifiers are in play and
three of them get called "the session id" in conversation.

```mermaid

    ROWKEY -->|"one row may carry no live instance at all - epoch NULL"| TRIPLE
    TRIPLE --> SID

    ROWKEY --> CLAUDE
    CLAUDE -->|"a uuid CHANGE mints a new row"| PARENT
    PARENT --> ROWKEY

    APPID -.->|"resolved to a tmux name, then to the triple"| TRIPLE
```

Four properties that make the rest of the document work:

1. **`session_uuid` is the row key. `claude_session_uuid` is the conversation.**
   One tmux instance holds MANY conversations in sequence - start, `/clear`,
   fork, compact. The table expresses that with one ANCHOR row keyed on the
   instance triple, plus one row per later conversation carrying
   `tmux_created_epoch = NULL` so it cannot collide with the anchor. See the
   module docstring of `src/core/session_lineage.py`.
2. **The label is not the name.** `sessions.title` is what the user typed.
   `tmux_name` is an internal handle derived from it. The derivation is one
   way and lossy; nothing reverses it at runtime.
3. **The rename discriminator takes BOTH halves.** Epoch alone is
   one-second resolution; `tmux_session_id` alone resets per tmux server
   lifetime. `src/core/session_lifecycle.py::rename_map` drops a
   discriminator seen twice in one listing rather than guessing.
4. **Adoption keys on the full triple, never the name.** tmux reuses names,
   so a name-keyed claim can land on a stranger's process -
   `src/core/session_identity.py::claim_instance`.

### The filter, and the fact that there are TWO of them

The brief describes one lossy label-to-name filter. The code has two, and the
one that documents itself as "THE FILTER" is not the one the create path runs.

```mermaid
graph LR
    LABEL["user label"] --> LIVE["_sanitize_tmux_name<br/>LIVE create path<br/>replaces only dot colon pipe and control chars<br/>keeps spaces, unicode, emoji<br/>collision suffix dash-2<br/>src/core/session_manager.py::_sanitize_tmux_name"]
    LABEL -.-> DEAD["sanitize_tmux_name plus unique_tmux_name<br/>NO PRODUCTION CALLER - tests only<br/>drops non-ASCII, strips shell metacharacters<br/>collision suffix underscore-2<br/>src/core/session_label.py::unique_tmux_name"]
    LIVE --> NAME["tmux_name actually created"]
    DEAD -.-> UNUSED["nothing"]
```

Both are cited so the drift test holds them; the divergence is recorded in
section 6.

```

**Archive versus delete, stated plainly.** There is one soft-delete verb for
sessions and it writes `sessions.archived_at`. There is no separate user-facing
"archive" - the column IS the delete. `src/core/session_store.py::archive_session`
is its only writer; nothing in `src/` issues `DELETE FROM sessions`.

**Origin is a one-way ladder.** `observed` can be promoted to `created` by the
import re-run, and `observed` can be claimed to `adopted`. Neither has a path
back.

```mermaid
graph LR
    OBS["observed<br/>seen, not ours<br/>src/core/db_models.py::SESSION_ORIGIN_OBSERVED"]

```

## 3. Project operations, and how they differ from sessions

Projects are **DB-only**. The mirrored `projects` key in `config.json` is gone;
a one-time migration moves anything the file still holds into the table and
removes the key.

```mermaid
graph TD
    classDef hard fill:#4a1f1f,stroke:#f28b82,color:#fce8e6

    AUTH["projects come from cloude.db, always<br/>TWO modes: db, or db_unreadable<br/>src/core/project_authority.py::resolve_projects"]
    AUTH -->|"db_unreadable REFUSES writes -<br/>a write could not detect a conflict"| RO["src/core/project_authority.py::require_writable"]

    MIG["one-time: move config.json projects into the table, drop the key<br/>src/core/projects_config_migration.py"]
    MIG --> AUTH

    PC["CREATE<br/>POST /projects"] --> PC1["refuse duplicate ROOT and duplicate NAME separately<br/>stamp last_opened_at so it sorts to the top<br/>src/core/project_writes.py::create_project"]
    PC1 --> PC2["CLEAR any tombstone - asking for the folder back<br/>supersedes an earlier deletion<br/>src/core/project_tombstones.py::clear_tombstone"]

    PU["RENAME / EDIT<br/>PATCH /projects/project_name"] --> PU1["src/core/project_writes.py::update_project"]

    PD["DELETE<br/>DELETE /projects/project_name"]:::hard --> PD1["a HARD DELETE FROM projects. not an archive.<br/>the folder on disk is not touched<br/>src/core/project_writes.py::delete_project"]:::hard
    PD1 --> PD2["a TOMBSTONE is written in the SAME transaction,<br/>or reconcile would re-import it from config.json<br/>src/core/project_tombstones.py::record_tombstone"]

    PP["PRESENCE is its own axis, four states<br/>present, missing, unreachable, UNCHECKED<br/>src/core/project_presence.py"] --> PP1["unchecked is a real state, not a stand-in for present<br/>GET /projects/presence"]
```

**The asymmetry is deliberate and worth stating once.** Deleting a SESSION is
soft, because history and transcripts are built on the row. Deleting a PROJECT
is hard plus a tombstone, because the row's only job is to be a launcher entry.
`projects.archived_at` exists in the schema and no code path writes it.

### Sidebar groups key on `tmux_name`, on purpose

```mermaid
graph LR
    G["session_group_members.tmux_name is the PRIMARY KEY<br/>src/core/session_group_store.py::assign"]
    G --> G1["NO check that the session exists.<br/>the sidebar's rows come from a live tmux probe and<br/>many have no sessions row at all - requiring one<br/>would make exactly those rows ungroupable"]
    G --> G2["one group per session, enforced by the key.<br/>ungrouped is the ABSENCE of a row, not a group called OTHER<br/>src/core/session_group_store.py::group_of"]
    G --> G3["a membership for a name that later disappears is harmless<br/>src/core/session_group_store.py::prune_missing"]
    G --> G4["deleting a group never deletes a conversation<br/>src/core/session_group_store.py::delete_group"]
```

## 4. FORK

> **GUI FORK IS BUILT. CLI FORK IS STILL SPECIFICATION.**
> Shipped 2026-08-26 on `feat/gui-fork`: `POST /sessions/{session_name}/fork`,
> a `fork` control on every owned running session row, and
> `src/core/session_fork.py`. The CLI-fork shape in 4.1 is still unbuilt,
> and it is the INVERSE of what ships - read 4.1 before assuming the two
> are the same feature.

### 4.0 What the GUI fork actually does - THIS PART IS BUILT

```mermaid
graph TD
    U["user clicks fork on a running session<br/>client/js/launchpad.js::_forkSession"]
    U --> R["POST /sessions/{session_name}/fork<br/>src/api/routes.py::fork_session"]
    R --> S["resolve the parent's LIVE anchor<br/>src/core/session_fork.py::resolve_fork_source"]

    S --> OK["READY - the row carries a claude_session_uuid"]
    S --> NC["NO CONVERSATION - 409, REFUSED.<br/>forking anyway would start a BRAND NEW conversation<br/>wearing a fork label<br/>src/core/session_fork.py::FORK_NO_CONVERSATION"]
    S --> UN["UNRESOLVED - 404, could not evaluate<br/>src/core/session_fork.py::FORK_UNRESOLVED"]

    OK --> L["label = parent label + (fork), append-only<br/>src/core/session_fork.py::fork_label"]
    L --> C["create_session with agent_extra_args<br/>--resume uuid --fork-session<br/>src/core/session_fork.py::fork_arguments"]
    C --> M["stamp parent_session_id + fork_kind on the CHILD<br/>src/core/session_fork.py::mark_as_fork"]
    M --> V["child has a parent AND a real epoch,<br/>so it is LISTED, unlike a conversation row<br/>src/core/session_store.py::list_sessions"]

    P["THE PARENT IS NOT TOUCHED.<br/>not archived, not stopped, not marked.<br/>still running, listed, resumable, forkable again"]
    M -.-> P
```

**There is no "was forked from" state, and that is deliberate.** The parent
process is never touched by a fork, so recording a state on it would be
writing a verdict about a session that is alive. "Was this forked from" is a
reverse lookup - `src/core/session_fork.py::children_of` - which costs nothing
and cannot go stale.

The fork arguments travel THROUGH the user's own wrapper rather than around
it (`src/config.py::Settings.get_agent_command`, `extra_args`), because the
wrapper is where their auth is set up. They are deliberately not gated on
`accepts_model`: that flag is about consuming an OpenRouter model id, and
gating the fork flags on it would make a fork through a modelless wrapper
silently launch a fresh conversation instead of the forked one.

### 4.1 The two fork shapes, as specified

```mermaid
graph TD
    classDef spec fill:#2b2b2b,stroke:#f28b82,stroke-width:3px,stroke-dasharray: 6 4,color:#fce8e6

    SPEC["SPECIFICATION ONLY - NOT BUILT"]:::spec

    GF["GUI FORK - fork from the interface"]:::spec
    GF1["creates and OPENS A NEW SESSION.<br/>the original keeps running, untouched"]:::spec
    GF2["THE CHILD IS THE NEW ROW.<br/>parent_session_id points back at the original"]:::spec
    GF --> GF1 --> GF2

    CF["CLI FORK - fork from inside a running session"]:::spec
    CF1["the PANE and the ROW continue,<br/>now carrying the NEW conversation"]:::spec
    CF2["the label gets a fork marker appended"]:::spec
    CF3["THE PARENT IS THE NEW ROW.<br/>the PRE-FORK conversation is inserted as its own row<br/>so it can be called back up"]:::spec
    CF --> CF1 --> CF2 --> CF3

    BOTH["BOTH record parent_session_id and fork_kind<br/>src/core/db_models.py::SESSION_FORK_KINDS"]:::spec
    GF2 --> BOTH
    CF3 --> BOTH
```

The two differ in **which side gets the new row**, and that is the whole design
decision. GUI fork: the new row is the CHILD. CLI fork: the new row is the
PARENT, because the running pane keeps its identity and it is the abandoned
conversation that needs somewhere to live.

### 4.2 What already exists to support it - THIS PART IS BUILT

```mermaid
graph TD
    H["Claude CLI SessionStart hook<br/>POST /hooks/claude-event"]
    H --> H1["source enum read out of the shipped binary 2.1.236:<br/>startup, resume, clear, compact, fork<br/>src/core/db_models.py::SESSION_FORK_KIND_FORK"]
    H1 --> H2["src/core/session_manager.py::record_claude_lifecycle_event"]

    H3 --> B["BOUND - anchor had no uuid, bind it<br/>src/core/session_lineage.py::LINEAGE_BOUND"]

    H3 --> F["FORKED - uuid provably CHANGED, insert a new row<br/>src/core/session_lineage.py::LINEAGE_FORKED"]
    H3 --> U["UNRESOLVED - could not work out which row.<br/>never folded into either success<br/>src/core/session_lineage.py::LINEAGE_UNRESOLVED"]

    F --> F1["fork_kind from source, unknown when unrecognised -<br/>never a plausible guess<br/>src/core/session_lineage.py::classify_fork_kind"]
    F --> F2["the new row carries tmux_created_epoch NULL,<br/>so it cannot collide with the anchor in the<br/>partial unique index<br/>src/core/db_models.py::DDL_SESSIONS_INSTANCE_INDEX"]
    F --> F3["lineage walking already works<br/>src/core/session_lineage.py::lineage_head<br/>src/core/session_lineage.py::lineage_chain"]
```

Also present and unused by any fork UI: the schema columns
`parent_session_id` and `fork_kind`, their index
`src/core/db_models.py::DDL_SESSIONS_PARENT_INDEX`, and the reopen inputs
`claude_session_uuid` plus `working_dir` on the row.

**The detector does NOT decide intent.** A fork is measured from a CHANGED
conversation uuid; `source` only names the KIND. `rename` and `fork` are
separated by INSTANCE EVIDENCE and never by intent - a fork is a genuinely new
tmux session with its own creation epoch, so it can never match an existing
rename discriminator. See the comment block in
`src/core/session_lifecycle.py::_reap_absent_instances`.

### 4.3 DECISIONS - both answered by the owner, 2026-08-26

| # | Question | ANSWER |
|---|---|---|
| F-1 | Does a forked-away PARENT get its own state, or does it reuse `archived_at`? | **NEITHER. The parent is not touched at all.** In neither fork shape does the parent die: a CLI fork keeps the same process, and a GUI fork spawns a second one alongside it. So there is no state to record - it stays running, listed, resumable and forkable again. `archived_at` keeps its single meaning, "the user deleted this from their lists". Asserted by `tests/test_session_fork.py::test_marking_a_fork_leaves_the_parent_byte_identical`. |
| F-2 | What does the fork marker do on a SECOND fork? | **Append.** `name(fork)(fork)`. Not deduplicated, not numbered, not capped. The owner's words: "it should never get like that, and it will need to be renamed, but thats my job." Inventing a scheme would be guessing at an intent already stated. |

## 5. Where each operation is triggered from

The same word means different things on different paths. This table is why.

| adopt a SESSION | `client/js/session-sidebar-clicks.js`, `client/js/launchpad.js` via `client/js/api.js::adoptSession` | none | `POST /sessions/adopt` | - | sighting row can be written by import |
| adopt a SERVER | - | `macOS/adoption-decision.js` - **different object entirely**, decides whether this bundle may take over a server already on the port | - | - | - |
| respawn | `client/js/session-sidebar-clicks.js`, `client/js/launchpad.js` via `client/js/api.js::respawnSession` | none | `POST /sessions/respawn` | - | - |
| rename - label | three controls, all on one shared validator `client/js/session-label.js`: `client/js/session-sidebar-rename.js`, `client/js/launchpad.js`, `client/js/terminal.js` | none | `PATCH /sessions/session_id/name` | - | - |

| fork - CLI | **NOT IMPLEMENTED** | **NOT IMPLEMENTED** | **NOT IMPLEMENTED** | lineage rows are written by `POST /hooks/claude-event` | - |
| project create / edit / delete | `client/js/api.js::createProject`, `client/js/api.js::updateProject`, `client/js/api.js::deleteProject` | none | `POST /projects`, `PATCH /projects/project_name`, `DELETE /projects/project_name` | - | `src/core/project_reconcile.py` re-reads config.json on start |

**The tray is read-only over sessions.** It polls `GET /sessions/list`
through `macOS/tray-api.js` and renders counts in `macOS/tray-status.js`. It
creates, renames and deletes nothing.

**The reconciler is not on a timer.** It runs inside the attachable-sessions
probe the home screen already pays for, and only when that listing is both `ok`
and complete - `src/core/session_manager.py::reconcile_lifecycle`.

## 6. Where the code contradicts the common description

Recorded because a chart that quietly smooths these over is worse than no
chart.

1. **There are TWO label-to-tmux-name filters, and the documented one is
   dead.** `src/core/session_label.py::sanitize_tmux_name` and
   `src/core/session_label.py::unique_tmux_name` have no caller in `src/` or
   `client/` - only tests. The live create path uses
   `src/core/session_manager.py::_sanitize_tmux_name`, which is far more
   permissive: it keeps spaces, unicode and emoji, replaces only `.`, `:`, `|`
   and control characters, and uniquifies with a `-2` suffix rather than `_2`.
   Any statement of the form "the filter drops non-ASCII" describes the dead
   one.

2. **The shipped lineage writer puts the NEW conversation in the NEW row -
   the opposite of the CLI-fork specification in 4.1.** On `FORKED`,
   `src/core/session_lineage.py::record_claude_session` inserts a row carrying
   the NEW `claude_session_uuid` with `parent_session_id` pointing at the head,
   and stamps that new row `lifecycle` stopped. The anchor row - the one keyed
   to the live tmux instance - keeps the OLD uuid. Specification 4.1 says the
   pane's row should carry the NEW conversation and the PRE-FORK conversation
   should become the new row. These are not the same write, and implementing
   4.1 means changing this function, not adding to it.

3. **Consequence of 2, worth its own line: after any `/clear`, compact-fork or
   `--fork-session`, the anchor row's `claude_session_uuid` is stale relative
   to what is actually running in the pane.** The current conversation is on a
   lineage row marked stopped. Any reader that resolves "which conversation is
   in this pane" from the anchor gets the previous one.

4. **Two client rename controls still handle a 409 the server can no longer
   produce.** `client/js/launchpad.js` and `client/js/terminal.js` both branch
   on `/409/` and "already in use". The rename surface stopped renaming tmux,
   so duplicate labels are legal and no 409 exists on that path - see the
   docstring of `rename_session_endpoint`. Dead branch, not a defect with a
   symptom.

5. **"Adopt" names two unrelated operations.** A SESSION adopt claims a tmux
   instance. A SERVER adopt - `macOS/adoption-decision.js` - decides whether a
   freshly launched bundle may take over an HTTP server already listening on
   the port. They share no code and no object.

## 7. What this document does NOT establish

- It does not prove the arrows are correct. The drift test proves only that
  every cited symbol and route exists.
- Activity status, unread state and toast lifecycle are out of scope; the
  status model is charted separately.
- `session_import`, the first-run one-way import that seeds `observed` rows, is
  drawn only where it feeds the origin ladder. Its evidence tiers are not
  charted.
